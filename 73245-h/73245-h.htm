<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
PARTING OF THE WAYS
</h3>

<p>
"Father, what <i>is</i> the matter?"
</p>

<p>
The question came in sharp tones
of distress from a young girl who at that
moment entered the breakfast-room.  Quickly
she sprang to her father's side and began
chafing his cold hands, as she gazed with
fear-stricken eyes into the beloved face
before her.
</p>

<p>
Cyril Woodford made no response, but sat
as if stunned, staring with apparently
unseeing eyes at the newspaper before him, which
his nerveless fingers had just dropped.  His
face was ashen, and there was a nervous
twitching about his lips as he tried to moisten
them with his tongue.
</p>

<p>
"Father dear, speak&mdash;tell me why you
look like this!  Has something terrible
happened?"
</p>

<p>
No answer came in words, but with a
shaking finger the man pointed to the heading
of a column in the newspaper in front of
him.
</p>

<p class="t3">
  GREAT FINANCIAL CRASH<br>
  FAILURE OF SAMPSON'S BANK, LTD.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
For a few seconds Margaret Woodford
looked at the words with a puzzled expression
wrinkling her brows, then something of the
trouble involved dawned upon her mind.
</p>

<p>
"Sampson's has failed, I see&mdash;does&mdash;does
it mean you have lost some money, dear?"
she asked a little hesitatingly.
</p>

<p>
"All&mdash;<i>all</i>," he said huskily, while a shiver
shook his frame as though he were attacked
with ague.
</p>

<p>
The girl's face paled.
</p>

<p>
There was silence in the room for a few
moments, and then, rising from her cramped
position at his side, she said gently:
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to ring for some fresh coffee,
father; yours is cold."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want anything; I couldn't eat,"
he answered.
</p>

<p>
But, ignoring this remark, she rang and
gave her order, and in a few minutes a fresh
cup of the fragrant beverage was poured out
and brought to him.
</p>

<p>
"Drink it, just to please me," she said
coaxingly, "you are so cold; and presently
you will explain it all to me, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
For a minute or two longer her father sat
silent, then hastily drained the cup before
him, rose a little uncertainly, and went out
of the room, leaving his breakfast still untasted.
</p>

<p>
His daughter remained seated, mechanically
eating a finger of toast, and deep in painful
thought.
</p>

<p>
She could not, of course, grasp the enormity
of this thing, but that it meant serious trouble
was evident.  She had never seen her father
disturbed like this before, and those last
words of his, repeated so despairingly, had
been enough to fill her with vague alarm.
It surely <i>could</i> not mean the giving up of
their beautiful home?  Why, the Abbey
House had been in their family for
generations, and every stone of it was precious to
her.  And she knew only too well how her
father loved it.
</p>

<p>
The Woodfords of the Abbey House were
well known in the county, and the thought
that strangers might one day occupy it had
never hitherto suggested itself to anyone's
mind.
</p>

<p>
Margaret started slightly as the idea for
the first time presented itself to her now.
</p>

<p>
She gazed with tear-dimmed eyes at the
beautiful grassy terraces, and the grand old
cedar-tree rearing its head in front of the
dining-room windows and sweeping the lawn
with its graceful branches.  It all looked
so peaceful outside in the morning sunlight,
as though nothing could disturb the calm
serenity of the place.
</p>

<p>
Alas! for appearances&mdash;how poor an index
they often are to the stern realities of life!
</p>

<p>
Mr. Woodford scarcely saw his daughter
any more that day; he remained in the
library until quite late in the afternoon,
refusing admittance to everyone, spending
his time in writing letters, and sorting papers
in his desk with nervous fingers.
</p>

<p>
At last Margaret could bear the suspense
no longer, and persisted in knocking at the
door until he responded to her entreaties to
come in.
</p>

<p>
"There is something very wrong with
the master to-day," said old John, the
man-servant, as he addressed his fellow-servants.
"Something <i>very</i> wrong," and he shook his
head dolorously as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;that there is, and no mistake,"
answered cook, "and as for Miss Margaret,
she looks as white as a sheet; just because
the master wouldn't come in to lunch she
must needs go without."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder what it means.  It's something
as come by post upset them, because things
seemed all right when the master came
down this morning; he looked as cheerful
as could be, and when I set eyes on him half
an hour later, I never saw anyone look
worse."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;I'll tell you what <i>I</i> think it is&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But cook's explanations, or ideas, were
cut short by the violent ringing of the library
bell, not once, but two or three times,
peremptorily.
</p>

<p>
"My! listen to that now, be quick, John!
Good gracious, I never heard a bell tugged
in that way before!"
</p>

<p>
John forgot he was getting on in years
as he hurried breathless up the stairs; he
felt already a presentiment of trouble, but
he was not prepared for what he found.
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;what&mdash;what's the matter, miss?"
he exclaimed, as he opened the library door
and hurried to his master's side.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know!&mdash;-oh, I don't know! but
father is very ill&mdash;send for the doctor, John,
quick&mdash;let George take the grey mare!"
</p>

<p>
John was shocked by what he saw, but
he was a sensible man who knew how to
keep his head in an emergency.  Without
further hesitation he hurried back to the
servants' hall even faster than he had left
it, and quietly issued his orders to the groom.
</p>

<p>
"Ride hard!&mdash;the master's very ill if I'm
not much mistaken;" and not waiting to
answer any of the questions which were
rained upon him, he at once returned to his
young mistress.
</p>

<p>
The time seemed interminable while the
two watched by the master of the house,
longing and praying in the silence of their
hearts for the medical man's arrival.
</p>

<p>
At last the welcome approach of his gig
sounded on the carriage drive, and in a few
moments more Dr. Crane was in the room&mdash;quiet,
calm, issuing his orders clearly and
decidedly, and bringing with him a sense of
comfort to the frightened girl.
</p>

<p>
When the patient was at last in bed, and
John installed to watch beside him, the
doctor called Margaret aside and placed an
arm-chair for her.
</p>

<p>
"Now tell me how this attack began, and
what you think brought it on?"
</p>

<p>
In a few words Miss Woodford described
the day's occurrences, and explained that
while her father was talking to her that
evening in the library, he suddenly cried
out as though in great pain and put his
hand to the back of his neck, then he seemed
to lose consciousness.
</p>

<p>
"What <i>is</i> it, doctor?"  Her sweet grey
eyes looked anxiously into his, as she asked
the question.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Crane paused a moment or two before
he answered, then he said slowly:
</p>

<p>
"He has had a stroke consequent upon
some unusual excitement or shock."
</p>

<p>
"A stroke?" repeated Margaret.  "Does
it mean then&mdash;that ... that he is too ill
to&mdash;to recover?"  And her voice trembled
as she spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I do not say that at all," answered
Dr. Crane; "he may, of course, get over this
quite well, but in that case he will probably
not be quite the same man again that he
was before it happened.  Perhaps," he
continued, "you do not know that your father
has consulted me more than once during
the last year with regard to his health?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I did not know that," she replied.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry to say so; but he has not
been robust for some time; his heart is not
what I should like it to be&mdash;but there, I am
frightening you, and I hope unnecessarily;
so far as I can see, there is no reason for
serious alarm to-night.  Be brave, child; if
there is to be illness in the house, you will
want all your strength; husband it now by
having a good meal and going to bed early,
and try to sleep.  I shall send the district
nurse in to sit up with Mr. Woodford, and
you can wire to town to-morrow for a
permanent one&mdash;at least&mdash;you can do that if&mdash;if
it is necessary," he added hesitatingly,
for as he was speaking the remembrance of
a hint of monetary difficulties in a recent
conversation with Mr. Woodford recurred
unpleasantly to his mind.
</p>

<p>
To think of his old friends, the inmates of
the Abbey House, being threatened with
poverty seemed almost too extraordinary
to be true.  Surely there must be a mistake
somewhere!
</p>

<p>
The kind doctor shook off the unpleasant
doubt, and, pressing the girl's hand warmly,
bade her farewell, with a last promise to
call later and not forget to send the nurse.
</p>

<p>
When he had gone, Margaret stole softly
into her father's room, and gazed silently at
the still figure upon the bed.
</p>

<p>
The patient was breathing a little unevenly,
but his eyes were closed, and he seemed to be sleeping.
</p>

<p>
Old John sat by the bedside anxiously
watching his master's face.
</p>

<p>
Reassured by her father's peaceful attitude,
his daughter went downstairs and did her
best to do as Dr. Crane had told her.  For
she was sensible enough to realise that if
there was trouble to be faced in the unknown
future, giving way at the outset would be
both foolish and cowardly.
</p>

<p>
After all, she was a Woodford, and with
the courage of her race she knew she must
meet difficulties with a stiff lip.
</p>

<p>
But it was a relief when Nurse Somers
arrived, with her cheerful air of confidence
and reliability, and took charge of the sick-room.
</p>

<p>
The next few days were like a dream to
Margaret; she seemed to live in another
world.  Her father rallied from this first
attack, and was sufficiently recovered to
spend some hours with his lawyer.  Then
his mind seemed to grow dull, and he talked
feebly and childishly of the old happy days
when his wife was alive and his daughter a
little child&mdash;the sunbeam and plaything of
the house.
</p>

<p>
A few days of weakness followed, then
came the night when the spirit took its flight
from earth's habitation, quietly and silently,
in answer to God's summons, and fled to
that sorrowless land where all is joy and peace,
and rest.  And in the dawn of the morning
the watchers saw only the hush of death's
release for the master; "<i>God's finger touched
him, and he slept.</i>"
</p>

<p>
Margaret did not break down; the sorrow
seemed too much to bear, too much to understand
at first.  She felt numb with grief;
her cold apathy disturbed the kind nurse,
who stayed until the funeral should be over.
</p>

<p>
"I wish she would cry," she remarked to
the doctor; "this terrible calm is unnatural,
and a fearful strain."
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;poor child, the reaction will,
I am afraid, be all the greater," he answered
sympathetically; "but youth is bound to
recover."
</p>

<p>
But it was not until the day of the funeral
that Margaret fully realised her loss, when
she knelt by her window alone, the pale moon
looking down upon her from the clear cold
sky.  Then the greatness of her bereavement
came over her, and she felt, in all the sadness
of realisation, the desolation of her future.
</p>

<p>
Her dear, dear father was taken from her,
the one being she loved in all the world, the
one who had been everything to her since
she had lost her mother, her darling
companion as well as parent.  And as though
to mock at her grief she had learned that
day for the first time from the lawyer's lips
that she was penniless.  Owing to the great
bank failure, her father's money had melted
away into thin air; and her home, the dear
old Abbey House, must pass into other
hands, and be sold at once to meet the
demands of her father's creditors.
</p>

<p>
To-night was hers&mdash;to-night she could
wander through the rooms, and take a last
farewell walk round the gardens and park,
and touch as she had touched the friend of
her childhood, the fine old cedar which had
silently watched many generations of
Woodfords seated under its sheltering boughs.
With tender, lingering fingers she had pressed
the smooth trunk, and then broken a tiny
piece of the beautiful evergreen, and put it
among her own personal treasures.  It was
that which lay in her hand now, and upon
which the fast-falling tears dropped, as she
said good-bye to the happiness of the old
home, so soon to pass into the possession of
strangers.  She covered her face, while silent
sobs shook her, in the sorrow of those
moments.
</p>

<p>
Presently she grew calm again, and, gazing
through the window of her room at those
bright worlds which canopy our earth above,
her lips moved, and her voice whispered to
the One Who knew all her trouble and
understood: "Father in Heaven, help me,
Thy child, to do Thy will wherever Thou
seest fit to send me."
</p>

<p>
There was no outward answer to that
prayer, but the answer was speeding to her
then, and strength to prepare her for the
difficult days to come.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
OAKLANDS
</h3>

<p>
"Oh, I wish the train would be quick,"
said a small child, addressing an
old man-servant who stood rather anxiously
guarding her, as she stamped impatiently
up and down upon the platform.  "What
makes it so long, James?  I want to see
her&mdash;because I shall know directly if she's
nice; if she isn't, I'll be naughty every day,
and make her just as unhappy as ever I
can, and then she'll go away like all the
others have.  I told daddy so this morning."
</p>

<p>
"I expect you'll like her, miss," answered
the man, with a grim smile, as he gazed with
affectionate amusement at the spoilt child
in front of him.
</p>

<p>
"If she's nasty, I'll hate her&mdash;so there."
</p>

<p>
"Come, come, missy, don't talk like that,"
he interposed.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I shall&mdash;look! there's the train
coming, the signal has gone down, now let's
see, James, who can find her first; I feel
sure she'll be horrid, and have an ugly old
bonnet on."
</p>

<p>
The train steamed into the station, puffing
and snorting vehemently as it came to a
standstill, and in a few minutes the
carriages had emptied themselves of their
passengers.
</p>

<p>
The old man-servant and little Ellice
Medhurst scanned carefully each possible
looking person who alighted, to see if they
answered to their ideas of the expected
governess they had come to meet.
</p>

<p>
She had sent no description of herself,
she had not thought of it, and in fact her
employer had forgotten her intention to
send to the station, until that afternoon
Miss Woodford's future pupil, with a
wilfulness which characterised her, had insisted
upon going herself to meet her, not from
politeness, but curiosity.  What sort of
person she was likely to expect she had not
waited to inquire, but telling James he was
to come with her&mdash;"Mamma said so"&mdash;she
set off with him in the little pony-carriage
to fetch the new governess to Oaklands.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
The journey had seemed long to Margaret
Woodford, as, occupied with her sad thoughts,
she gazed out of the carriage windows, taking
only a languid interest in the stations she passed.
</p>

<p>
She was still feeling the terrible shock of
her father's death and failure, and the loss
of the dear old home.
</p>

<p>
This venture into the great unknown
world was a great trial, and it required all
her courage to face it as bravely as she was doing.
</p>

<p>
Her heart glowed with gratitude towards
Mrs. Crane, as she thought of her parting
words: "Remember, you are not to stay
if you are not happy, but to come back to
us, and we will look for something else for
you."
</p>

<p>
Happy!  She didn't expect to be that,
but she would try to be content and to do
her duty; she was sure the promise was
hers, "I will be with thee in all places
whithersoever thou goest."  God knew the
way that she took, and He would direct her
path.  That was the one great fact which
sustained Margaret Woodford's courage as
she faced the world alone for the first time
in her life.
</p>

<p>
She had started for London that morning
from her old home in the North, and travelled
by the 4.15 from town, and now in the fading
afternoon light she caught her first glimpse
of the garden of England, as the train steamed
past country lanes, cherry orchards, and hop
grounds rising into renewed life as the season
advanced.
</p>

<p>
The only other occupants of her carriage
appeared to be two farmers&mdash;at least she
judged they were of that persuasion, by the
agricultural topics of conversation which
seemed to engross them.  Her interest was
aroused by their eagerness and enthusiasm;
one of them, drawing out of his pocket a
little square parcel, hastily untied the string,
and, handing it to his companion, said:
</p>

<p>
"'Taste that, and tell me what you think
of it.  I can assure you I never grew a finer sample."
</p>

<p>
Margaret expected to see something eatable,
and was more than surprised to witness the
man bury his nose in the parcel and, after
drawing a deep breath, gasp.
</p>

<p>
"Beautiful&mdash;beautiful, and if it wasn't
for this foreign competition eating our very
pockets, you'd be making a fine price now
on these last years.  I think you did right
to hold them up.  What we are coming to,
I don't know; trade is being driven out of
the country, and there's nothing but ruin
staring most of us in the face.  Fortunately,
I was in the swim when one got £20 per
pocket; but <i>now</i>, well&mdash;they are not worth
growing; I've grubbed up several acres this
season."
</p>

<p>
There the conversation got quite beyond
Margaret's comprehension, as further
technicalities in connection with the hop trade
were discussed, with summer fruit prices.
</p>

<p>
Already she felt in a new world, and a
sense of loneliness oppressed her.  Her
thoughts passed from the subjects of her
companions' discussion to her own troubles,
and a nervous unrest as to whether she was
getting near her destination.
</p>

<p>
The stoppings at small stations seemed
frequent, and at each one she gazed anxiously
at the names written on the boards and seats
upon the platforms.
</p>

<p>
Her obvious nervousness presently attracted
the attention of one of her travelling
companions.
</p>

<p>
"Can I assist you?" he asked her politely,
as he saw her struggling to get some of her
property down from the rack.  "I suppose
you are getting out here?"  The train was
slowing up as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you very much," she answered,
as the bundle of wraps was deposited on the
seat opposite, then continued anxiously, "I
don't know if this is my destination."
</p>

<p>
"What station do you want?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Steynham.  I don't know it at all."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that is a little farther on; four
more stations, and then yours," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"Do I have to change at all?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"No, this is slow from our last stopping-place."
</p>

<p>
"I am so much obliged," she answered,
in a tone of relief.
</p>

<p>
After a little pause her companion
continued, "I know Steynham very well, and
most of the people who live there; can I
direct you further?"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, I'm afraid not.  I get out
at that station, but I shall be met there, I
expect.  I am going on higher up the country
beyond Wychcliff, to a place called
Oaklands&mdash;a Mr. Medhurst's."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Oaklands&mdash;Medhurst,</i>" repeated her
interlocutor with a slight start, which she
did not fail to catch.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know anything about it&mdash;about
them?" she asked somewhat timidly, for
the man's tone and expression as he repeated
the words had filled her with a vague disquiet.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;oh&mdash;no, I've never been there, never
met Mr. Medhurst," he answered, somewhat
hesitatingly.
</p>

<p>
He offered no further remark, and remained
apparently buried in his newspaper until
the train drew up, and he and his companion
prepared to get out.  As they alighted, he
turned to Margaret Woodford.
</p>

<p>
"The next station is yours," and, lifting
his hat, passed down the platform out of her sight.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know anything of the place she's
going to?" asked his friend, as they descended
the steps.
</p>

<p>
"Not exactly, but I'm sure I've heard
no good of it; there's some sort of mystery,
or scandal attached to it, I believe, and
folks say the youngsters are terrors.  I am
sorry that is the girl's destination; she's
young and pretty&mdash;evidently a lady, I should
say, and looks as if she's had trouble.  But
there, one can't pick up strangers' burdens,
we've plenty of anxieties of our own just
now."  And the subject of Margaret Woodford
and her possible sorrows and difficulties
passed from their minds as they emerged
through the station door, jumped into the
gigs awaiting them, and drove away to their homes.
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes more the train reached
Steynham.  The girl gazed up and down
the platform, feeling more friendless than
ever now she no longer heard the kindly
voice of her fellow-traveller.  She felt she
would have been glad if she could have had
his companionship until she was safely under
the care of her employers.
</p>

<p>
This tall, elegant-looking girl getting out
at Steynham did not pass unnoticed; her
high-bred air and softly modulated voice
quickly attracted the attention of the railway
officials, who gathered round her as she
stood, the one solitary passenger, beside her
box.
</p>

<p>
"Is there a carriage to meet me?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think so, miss," replied a porter,
running to take a look up the road.
</p>

<p>
"No, there is no vehicle here, and none
in sight, miss.  Who were you expecting?"
</p>

<p>
The question was put with a desire to
render assistance, for the Steynham porters
knew all the surrounding gentry, and a good
deal about them too, if village gossip was
to be relied upon.
</p>

<p>
"I am expecting someone to meet me
from Mr. Medhurst's&mdash;Oaklands is the
address, near Wychcliff."
</p>

<p>
"Near Wychcliff&mdash;Oaklands!" repeated
one or two of the officials.  "Don't know it,
miss&mdash;don't know the name."
</p>

<p>
"Then&mdash;what can I do?" said Margaret,
a slight quiver in her voice.
</p>

<p>
"I'll ask the station-master," said the
first speaker, and, hurrying to the ticket-office,
he soon returned with a fresh authority.
</p>

<p>
"<i>What</i> place was it you wanted?" he
asked politely.
</p>

<p>
"Oaklands," repeated Margaret for the
third time&mdash;"Mr. Medhurst's."
</p>

<p>
A shade of surprise crept over the
station-master's face.
</p>

<p>
"Did you say <i>Oaklands</i>?" he repeated.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;yes, that is the name.  Oh, you do
know it?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," he replied, "and I fancy a
pony-trap from there met the earlier
down-train; a man-servant and a little girl came
and watched the passengers alight, and then
drove off again."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that is it then!  They must have made
some mistake in the time of the train.  Now,
what can I do?  Is this place far away?"
asked Margaret, somewhat anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Several miles, miss.  It's right up on the
hills."
</p>

<p>
For a few moments nervous fear assailed
her, and then she said bravely, "Can you
get me a cab?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll see, miss," one of the porters answered
civilly.  "You come into the waiting-room,
and I'll go and fetch Mr. Cramp."
</p>

<p>
"Who is he?" she inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he's the man that has the fly.  If it
isn't out, it'll be here in half an hour."
</p>

<p>
Half an hour!  Her heart died at the
prospect, as she followed her luggage down
the platform into the stuffy little waiting-room.
The window was closed, and it looked
as if it ought to have a poster up with "TO
LET" on the door.
</p>

<p>
"The station is more comfortable, I think,"
said the porter, taking a considering look at
the elegant figure in front of him, as, setting
down her bags a moment, he turned to her and
motioned to the bench by the entrance door.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, I will wait here."
</p>

<p>
"I won't be long, miss," he continued
encouragingly.  "I'll just give these to the
booking-clerk to look after, and I'll be back
in no time."
</p>

<p>
In a few moments more she had the
satisfaction of seeing him start out briskly,
and pass through the white station gates.
</p>

<p>
Wearily she gazed out of the window.  It
was a warm day, in early summer, and the
scene before her was not wholly dispiriting.
A straight road from the station led up to
the village; on the left was a squarely built
house with the words "Coffee Tavern"
written upon it in large letters; then came a
few cottages.  The road was sheltered at places
by some fine old elms, and on the right
hand she saw something that made almost
a thrill of hope pass through her, as she
drank in the sight and breath of its beauty.
</p>

<p>
Spring had long since awakened the sleeping
trees, rich life-giving sap had risen, and
the sun coaxed them into opening their eyes
to the new season.  The orchard upon which
Margaret was now gazing showed her a
wealth of promise, as the gleam of fruit
clusters shining through the green foliage
caught her eye.
</p>

<p>
The outlook on the opposite side of the
station, which she could just see through
another window, was the exact counterpart
of that near to where she was sitting, and
presented a view prosaic enough, which
needed some conjuring of the mind to suggest
any ideas of romance.
</p>

<p>
Margaret tried to be interested, but her
thoughts were trailing back to the dear old
home surroundings when she heard the
rumble of a cab.  A few minutes later a
one-horse vehicle drew up at the door, and
her friend the porter jumped down, as she
rose with alacrity and went to meet him.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right, miss, he knows Wychcliff,
and says he can find 'Oaklands' when he
gets there&mdash;it's an old farm that has stood
empty for some time."
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes more Margaret had started
upon her quest.
</p>

<p>
Steynham, quiet enough in the spring-time,
but showing much more life as the fruit
and hop seasons come round, was soon left
behind, and the gradual ascent to Wychcliff
was begun&mdash;a long drive through two or
three villages, and then a steep climb up a
narrow, grass-grown road, to the hills beyond.
There was only room for one vehicle at a
time, and Margaret was startled by suddenly
hearing the driver calling at the top of his
voice, "Hie&mdash;back&mdash;there!&mdash;back!" and the
old cab came to a sudden standstill with a
violent jerk.  A sharp altercation ensued
between the two Jehus, which sounded
decidedly uncomplimentary; then her vehicle
was jerked backwards down the hill, nearly
overturning as it ran up on to the bank.
</p>

<p>
Miss Woodford was used to horses, and
not easily frightened, so she sat tight,
preferring the chance of an upset to getting
out on to this unknown, narrow road, and
in the darkness trying to find standing-room
in the hedge.  It was not a pleasant
experience, as those who have driven up, or down
Wychcliff hill in the evening can testify.
Here and there at long intervals there are
wider spaces cut back into the adjacent
fields to allow vehicles to pass.  Fortunately,
one was near, and after much jolting and
noise, with a good deal of argument on the
part of the drivers, and a last shout from
Cramp, whose temper was now up, of
"'Nother time I'll see you back yer old
caërt before I stop my currage for such as
<i>yew</i>!"&mdash;and the cab crawled on again.
</p>

<p>
Would it ever end? she wondered, and
the remembrance of that dark, lonely drive,
with night settling down around her, never
quite faded from her mind, although she
little knew then the fears and doubts that
were to await her later.
</p>

<p>
By dint of inquiry at a solitary cottage,
which was passed at the top of the hill, they
discovered the whereabouts of Oaklands Farm.
</p>

<p>
In the gloom Margaret could not see what
her future home was like, the darkness being
increased by the thick trees which
surrounded it, only leaving just room for the
cab to draw up before the front door.
</p>

<p>
She got out and paid her fare, as the man
set down her box on the step, and then,
after violently ringing the bell, climbed back
to his seat.
</p>

<p>
"Seems pretty lonely," he remarked, as
he gathered up the reins; "not much of a
place for a young lady like you."
</p>

<p>
The girl shivered at his words.
</p>

<p>
"Look here," he continued, "if you want
to get away whoam any time, yew jest write
to Mr. Cramp, Cab Driver, Steynham, and
I'll come for yer, miss&mdash;see?"
</p>

<p>
Tears rose in the back of Margaret's eyes
at the mention of the word home.  She
thanked the kindly old man, who was always
liked by his "fares," but she did not explain
her destitute condition to him.
</p>

<p>
He waited, after setting her box on the
step, until the door opened, and looked
backward as he drove away to see she had
entered.  Then he vanished into the darkness.
</p>

<p>
As the door opened, Margaret was agreeably
impressed by the bright glow of the hall into
which she entered.  The man-servant who
appeared was civilly polite; the dark oak
furniture and rich red carpet and walls,
artistically decorated, gave a sense of warmth
and comfort to the tired girl.  Then she was
startled by hearing a shrill voice screaming
over the banisters:
</p>

<p>
"So you are here at last, and I can't even
come and look at you, because I'm supposed
to be in bed.  It is a shame!  I want&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Go back, Miss Ellice, now," said James
reprovingly; "the master will hear you."
</p>

<p>
"Who cares!" said the elf, leaning still
further over the balustrade until she was in
danger of falling.
</p>

<p>
At that moment the dining-room door
opened, and the child, in spite of her boasting,
disappeared, as a tall, dark, well-set-up man appeared.
</p>

<p>
"Is it really Miss Woodford?" he inquired,
holding out his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I'm afraid I'm very late, but I
had a difficulty in finding a conveyance at
the station.  I hope I've not caused any
inconvenience."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed no; the fault is ours.  I must
apologise.  We sent a trap to meet you, but
unfortunately Mrs. Medhurst made a mistake
about the train&mdash;we have only just found it
out.  I'm sorry you've had the trouble of
finding your way here alone."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, here's Betsy," he added, addressing
an elderly woman who at that moment made
her appearance in the hall.  "Will you take
Miss Woodford upstairs at once," he said,
"and then," turning to Margaret, "we shall
be ready for dinner, when I can introduce
you to my wife; your little charge is in bed,
and asleep by this time, I expect."
</p>

<p>
This last was received with a grim smile by
old James, as the young governess followed
the woman to her bedroom.
</p>

<p>
A bright fire was blazing on the hearth,
which was pleasant, for the early summer
nights were still cold.  Margaret glanced
around her room with pleasure.  The subdued
green carpet, cream-tinted walls, and shelf
of goblin blue china all expressed a thoughtful
kindness and artistic taste.
</p>

<p>
As she laid her toilet requisites on the old
Chippendale table, Margaret's heart gave a
throb of thankfulness that her environment
was so tasteful and pleasant.  There surely
could be nothing to fear here?  Mr. Medhurst
was evidently a gentleman, while the servants
she had seen were of the good class so often
regretted in this century.  Her future pupil
might prove a handful, but that part of her
life had to be tested.
</p>

<p>
She felt she was travel-stained, but she
did not wish to keep dinner waiting, so,
refreshed with a wash, and smoothing her
hair which, in spite of much brushing, would
ripple in natural, careless waves over her
forehead, she prepared to descend.
</p>

<p>
Betsy was outside waiting, and in another
moment threw open the dining-room door,
and announced "Miss Woodford."
</p>

<p>
There was a rustle of silk, a subtle scent of
violet perfume, and a tall, graceful woman
rose from the table to receive her.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Medhurst spoke a little languidly as
she welcomed the governess, giving her hand
a slight pressure as she said kindly, "I
am so glad you have come!  You will excuse
our beginning; we had almost given up
expecting you, but my husband has told
me of my stupid mistake."
</p>

<p>
Margaret was a little disconcerted, as she
took the seat offered to her, to find her
hostess in full evening-dress, the rich yellow
velvet throwing up the beauty of her dark
eyes and olive-tinted skin.  A collar of
diamonds flashed rainbow hues upon her
white neck.
</p>

<p>
The conversation flagged, but from time
to time Mrs. Medhurst appealed to Margaret
in her soft modulated voice.
</p>

<p>
She was a beautiful woman, exquisitely
dressed, as though she might be going to a
dinner-party; the servants and appointments
of the house, so far as Margaret could
judge, seemed all perfect in their way.
</p>

<p>
Miss Woodford of Woodford Abbey knew
how things ought to be done, and she was
pleasantly surprised at her surroundings.
But the thought would present itself, why
were these people living in this lonely
out-of-the-way place?  It seemed so utterly
incongruous, considering their style.  The
girl tried to smother the thought, and, being
young, and withal hungry, was able to
enjoy the meal in spite of the sense of
strangeness which pervaded the place.
</p>

<p>
"Will you come into the drawing-room
with me?" said the hostess, as she gave the
signal to rise from the table.
</p>

<p>
Miss Woodford was glad the invitation
had been given, as she was not quite sure
how much she was to be received into the
family, or exactly what her position was to be.
</p>

<p>
The drawing-room was a dream of cosiness,
comfort, and taste.  The chairs and couch
were of the easiest, the dove-coloured walls,
against which stood some handsome cabinets
of old china, the rich pile carpet where one's
feet sank softly, gave a feeling of rest and
luxury which reminded Margaret of her
boudoir at Woodford Abbey.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Medhurst sat sipping her coffee and
lazily fanning herself at intervals, until,
presently, Margaret inquired if she might
ask her a few questions as to her future
duties.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, certainly.  I don't think I have
much to tell you," she answered, "except
I should like you to have breakfast in the
dining-room, and lunch with Ellice in the
school-room, and dine with us in the evening.
We are so quiet here, we shall be glad of
your society then.  I am having the rest
cure," she said, with a strange little laugh,
"and although I am much better than I
was, it really is almost too quiet at times."
</p>

<p>
"I am so sorry you have been ill," said
Margaret sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
"I have been dreadfully weak.  I'm
gradually gaining strength now, but I can't
stand Ellice's high spirits, and so I pass her
on to you.  Manage her as you like."
</p>

<p>
"I will do my best," said Margaret.
"You know I have had no experience, but
I love children, and always have got on with
them."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes.  I expect she'll be good with
you; you are young, and will be able to enter
into her pleasures better than I can&mdash;my
poor head is unable to bear much."
</p>

<p>
"And about the lessons?" asked the new
governess.
</p>

<p>
"Teach her just as you like.  She's a fearful
little ignoramus, I'm afraid; she's made up
of oddments.  Anything she can pick up
from the cottagers, or from her father, she
retains with ease, but knowledge she ought
to have acquired she is quite deficient in,
I imagine.  I'm afraid you'll be horrified at
her ignorance."
</p>

<p>
Margaret rose and placed a cushion at
Mrs. Medhurst's back, as she noticed she fidgeted
restlessly in her chair.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you&mdash;thank you; that's heaps
nicer.  How kind of you to notice!" and the
sweet smile that accompanied the words
transfigured the otherwise cold look of the
speaker's beautiful face.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Medhurst came into the room soon
after, and the conversation became more
general.  Several times he glanced anxiously
at his wife, and then he crossed to Miss
Woodford:
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Medhurst has not been very well
to-day, and one thing she enjoys more than
anything else is music; we are so shut off
from it here.  Would it tire you too much to
sing, or play?"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't unpacked my box, but I can
remember some of Mendelssohn's short things,
if that will do?" answered Margaret readily.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, indeed, she likes them so much."
</p>

<p>
The piano was one of Brinsmead's best,
and the musician soon lost herself in the
joy of her themes.  Her touch was exquisite,
and she seemed to pour her whole soul into
the expression she produced from her fingers.
She went from "The Bees' Wedding," thrilling
with its busy revellings, into quieter
grooves, until gently there stole through the
room the subtle exquisiteness of No. 1 of
"Songs Without Words."
</p>

<p>
There was a hush over the room as she
rose from the piano, and for a moment she
feared she had not given pleasure.  Then
she caught the grave glance of appreciation
of her host as, offering her a seat, he said
quietly, "Thank you."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Medhurst did not speak, but as she
rose to say good night, Margaret noticed
something like the glimmer of tears in her
eyes.
</p>

<p>
The girl was very tired when she went to
bed, and the sun was streaming in at her
window before she awoke the following
morning.
</p>

<p>
She sat up and looked round her room
with a puzzled air, wondering vaguely for
a few moments where she was.  Then the
remembrance of all that had happened
returned, and, looking at her watch, she
discovered with dismay it was nine o'clock.
She dressed hurriedly, and came downstairs,
feeling anxious as to what would be thought
of her unpunctuality if breakfast should be
over.  No one last night had remembered
to tell her what hour it would be, and she
had forgotten to ask.
</p>

<p>
She encountered James in the hall with
a tray in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid I am late," she ventured.
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, miss; Miss Ellice is in the garden,
and has not breakfasted yet.  You're all
right," he answered, a little patronisingly.
</p>

<p>
Margaret heard the words with a great
sense of relief.
</p>

<p>
The dining-room looked delightful in the
morning light; the casement windows were
thrown wide open, and roses peeped a welcome
into the room.
</p>

<p>
Miss Woodford noticed the table was laid
for two only, and wondered.
</p>

<p>
Presently the door opened, and James
appeared.
</p>

<p>
"Will you like breakfast now, miss?" he
inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;yes&mdash;but what about Mrs. Medhurst?"
she inquired.
</p>

<p>
"She always takes hers upstairs, and the
master has it with her when she's had a bad
night," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry she is not so well?" she replied.
</p>

<p>
The interrogative tone of her voice brought
no response from the man-servant who waited.
</p>

<p>
"What about my pupil, won't she breakfast
with me?" inquired Miss Woodford.
</p>

<p>
"I can't say, miss.  I wouldn't advise
you to wait for her; she's off in the woods
somewhere, and there's no knowing when
she'll come back.  Betsy will keep something
hot for her."
</p>

<p>
"Oh.  I see"&mdash;and the new governess
realised something of the difficulty of her
position as she sat down&mdash;"I won't delay
any longer then."
</p>

<p>
She had not quite finished when she heard
a child's laugh, and the door was flung
open,-and a sharp little voice exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"There you are; I thought I'd find you
here.  Good morning, Miss&mdash;oh, what's your
name?"
</p>

<p>
"Good morning.  I'm Miss Woodford, and
you&mdash;you are my pupil Ellice, aren't you?"
said the new governess, with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I wonder what your other name is?"
</p>

<p>
"It's Margaret."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's rather nice; it's nothing like
mine.  Isn't it stupid I can't call you by it?
Mamma said I was to say <i>Miss</i> Woodford
when I spoke to you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course, because you are a lady,
you see, and <i>ladies</i> always behave politely&mdash;they
can't help it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;yes&mdash;I&mdash;see," answered the child,
drawling the words out in surprised tones.
</p>

<p>
Here was a puzzle.  This new governess
seemed to think she <i>couldn't</i> behave
rudely&mdash;because&mdash;because she was a lady!  It was
awkward; she hadn't thought of it like
that before.  It looked as if the fun was
going to be spoilt.  A puzzled expression
of disappointment clouded her face for a
moment, but in an instant it lighted with
an illuminating flash, as a thought rushed
to her mind.  "I wonder what she'll think
on Saturday?"
</p>

<p>
She was an interesting looking child, but
she had none of her mother's beauty, the
brilliant brunette which had so struck Miss
Woodford.  Ellice was a fairy-looking little
creature, with dancing blue eyes, tiny features,
and tumbled ringlets.  She certainly looked
like an elf from the woods as she stood with
the front of her dress caught up in one hand,
and filled with wild roses, tufts of yellow
vetch, scabious, bundles of dainty milkmaids
which she had dragged from the nettle-beds,
regardless of their stings, and sweet
clumps of wild parsley&mdash;all in mingled
profusion, while she carelessly swung a straw
hat by a broken elastic, the blue ribbon
of which was stained with cherry juice that
matched the dye on her fingers.
</p>

<p>
"You have spoilt your hat trimming,"
said Miss Woodford, taking the article (which
evidently received little respect) from the
small owner.
</p>

<p>
"I did that jumping under the trees to
get at the waterloos.  I <i>had</i> a feast, but ever
so many tumbled on to me."
</p>

<p>
"Well, now are you ready for breakfast?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not very hungry.  James&mdash;James,"
shrilled the child, "bring me some cake and
milk&mdash;and be quick!"
</p>

<p>
"Better have your egg, missy," answered
the man.
</p>

<p>
"No, I won't!  Cake&mdash;cake&mdash;<i>cake</i>&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But the master said you must have your
proper meal, Miss Ellice."
</p>

<p>
"Then, I won't!  Get that cake&mdash;swish!"
and she swung her skirts round, scattering
her flowers in all directions.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," answered the man hopelessly,
turning to retire.
</p>

<p>
"Stay," said Miss Woodford firmly, "did
I understand Mr. Medhurst said Miss Ellice
was to have an egg for breakfast?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, miss, but she won't eat it when
she wants cake."
</p>

<p>
"Then she isn't hungry, and had better
wait until lunch," answered the new governess.
</p>

<p>
James's eyes grew round with astonishment.
Two governesses had been tried before,
but they had both departed in a week, utterly
defeated by the small person who now stood
between them, her eyes blazing defiance.
</p>

<p>
"I don't care what you say, I <i>will</i> have
cake; I'll go and ask Betsy."  With this
the small figure flew to the kitchen,
demanding attention to her wants in a storm of
passionate cries.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, missy, I'll get the tin down.
Don't make such a fuss, dearie, you'll disturb
your poor mamma," entreated cook persuasively.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Ellice is not to have any cake,
Betsy," said Miss Woodford's voice decidedly.
</p>

<p>
The woman turned round to find the new
governess standing by her side.  She looked
her amazement, and then dropped her hands
from the cupboard:
</p>

<p>
"Very well, miss."
</p>

<p>
The colour rushed to Ellice's face, words
seemed to fail her for a moment, then, with
a stamp of her foot, the child turned and
fled out of the kitchen and disappeared down
the drive, and was lost in the adjacent woods.
</p>

<p>
A sigh broke from the cook.
</p>

<p>
"There you have it, miss.  You'll never
be able to manage her, I'm afraid; she's just
too much for all the governesses what comes."
</p>

<p>
"Anyway I must try, mustn't I, Betsy?"
answered Margaret, adding, "It's my duty.
Poor little thing, she does need someone
to help her," finished Margaret, as she turned
back into the hall.
</p>

<p>
"Someone to help her!&mdash;umph.  She's
a bit different from the others.  James,
think she'll do?" asked his wife, amazement
in her voice.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;don't&mdash;know&mdash;I give it a week,"
answered the man grimly.  "Saturday is
the test."
</p>

<p>
Miss Woodford went up to her room, and
sat down by the open window with, it must
be admitted, a little feeling of despair in
her heart.  She could see rocks ahead, and
she had had no experience, and surely the
task here was going to be a big one.  A
great homesickness came over her; she felt
the lump rising in her throat and almost
choking her.  This was to be her home now,
and already the one being in whom she had
felt an interest, and from whom she had
hoped to win affection, had rushed from
her with hatred in her heart and a malignant
expression of passionate dislike disfiguring
her face.
</p>

<p>
Presently Margaret roused herself and
commenced unpacking her box.  Beyond her
clothes she had brought one or two personal
treasures: the bit of the old cedar-tree;
a water-colour drawing of the Abbey House,
which she promptly hung up upon the wall,
where an unused nail remained driven in.
Her ivory toilet ware, with her name
"Margaret" traced in gold across the backs
of the brushes and mirror, and a beautiful
dressing-case of the same lovely ware, which
contained a family heirloom in the shape of
a ruby necklace, the stones of which flashed
their fire in the sun's rays, as now she lifted
the lid.  She took it out for a moment; the
gems streamed from her fingers, held together
by tiny links of gold.
</p>

<p>
She had a memory of her mother with
that very chain about her neck, and she, a
child, begging for it, and the laughing voice
saying, "Not now, darling, but it will be
yours when I am gone."  How lightly the
words had been spoken, and how soon had
the separation come!  Much as she treasured
the jewels, the stones felt cold in her hand
to-day as she gathered them up and replaced
them in the case.
</p>

<p>
Her things disposed of, she drew a chair
to the open window and sat down.  The lilt
of the birds' songs fell sweetly upon her
ears; her thoughts became a reverie over
the past, an expression of pain lurked in
the depths of her eyes&mdash;and they were eyes
full of womanly tenderness, and yet capable
of expressing undeveloped strength.
</p>

<p>
Presently her fingers touched the book
which lay upon the table near her.  With
quick impulse she drew it towards her, an
unspoken petition rising in her heart: "Lord,
give me a message from Thee."
</p>

<p>
She opened the book at random, and her
glance fell upon these words: "<i>I rose and
did the king's business.</i>"  She glanced back
and read, as she had often read before, of
the solemn vision granted to the prophet
when he was shown something of the trouble
to come in the latter days, the distress of
nations before the Kingdom of the Lord
should be established upon the earth.  In
his grief he fainted, the burden of the vision
causing sickness to come upon him; then
he braced himself, and she read: "I, Daniel,
rose, and <i>did the king's business</i>."  The duty
just there&mdash;the work to be carried on.
</p>

<p>
The words acted like a tonic.  A vision
of the coming years of loneliness and
difficulty had dismayed her, and yet
here&mdash;surely work for the King of kings lay all
around; the greater the difficulty, the more
insistent the call.  For a moment her head
sank upon her hands, and her heart was
lifted up to Him Who ever waits to pour
out a sufficient supply of strength to His
people, to meet every need.
</p>

<p>
Margaret Woodford believed this, and for
that day at least she laid her burden straight
at her Saviour's feet, and rose calm and
determined to face the future bravely, and
do the work nearest, to which she had been
called.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Ellice, a storm of passion raging
in her heart, rushed into the woods, pushing
the tangled branches fiercely apart until
she came to the fairy glade, a moss-grown
path where the trees parted in a glorious
avenue and the sunlight stole through in
shafts of golden light, and fell tenderly upon
the child.  She flung herself down under
a venerable oak, the trunk of which, cleft
by some old-world storm, formed a hiding-place
where she had often before sheltered
on rainy mornings, and whispered her secrets
to the woods.
</p>

<p>
Short, gasping sobs almost choked her as
she lay upon the ground.  The squirrels
scampered in the branches overhead and,
clinging to the rugged trunk of the great
Forest King, crept down to the foot and
peeped shyly at her, waiting wonderingly
for her call, and the food she so often
temptingly offered them.  Her sobbing breaths
of distress presently ceased, she raised a
tear-stained face, and brushed away the
tell-tale signs of distress.  A hard, sullen
expression swept all the beauty from her
countenance; she looked what her brother
would have said, "real ugly," as she pursed
up her lips and stared aimlessly at the
beauty around her.
</p>

<p>
The horrid pangs of hunger would make
themselves felt, and she wished now she had
not come away in such a hurry; even an
egg would have been preferable to this
hunger.  If she could be certain of not
meeting that hateful governess, she would steal
back to the house.  She had almost made
up her mind to make the attempt, when
she was startled by a footstep in the glade,
and a voice calling her by name.  She set
her teeth hard, and drew back further into
the shelter of the oak.
</p>

<p>
Miss Woodford, who was evidently bent
on searching for her charge, receiving no
answer to her calls, presently sat down upon
the mossy ground at the foot of the very
tree where Ellice was hidden.  Opening a
basket of sandwiches and jam-puffs, she
commenced her lunch, while the child, all
unknown to her, kept watch, struggling
with her pride as she saw the tempting
viands gradually disappearing before her
eyes.
</p>

<p>
The trees tossed their branches in a light
breeze which whispered among the leaves;
the day grew hotter.  Margaret felt tired
as she rested her head against the oak bark
where she leaned.  This picnic with her
young charge had been arranged in her own
mind, with a hope of friendship and
understanding, as a happy result.  As presently
she rose to shake the crumbs from her lap,
a voice from somewhere muttered, "She is
a pig to eat it all up."
</p>

<p>
Margaret Woodford paused, in a thoughtful,
listening attitude; then she turned, and her
eyes roved about the tree where she stood.
She took a few steps round the trunk till
she espied the cavity and the gleam of
muslin embroidery from the child's dress
which escaped at the opening, as she pressed
her back against the inside of her castle to
avoid being seen.
</p>

<p>
"What a jolly little place!" remarked
Margaret, as she caught sight of the child.
"I wish I'd found this before, we might
have had lunch on the doorstep of your
domain.  I've just finished mine.  Where
will you have yours?"
</p>

<p>
"You've eaten it all," muttered the child sulkily.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;look, I've kept some.  You surely
didn't think I'd been greedy enough to finish
the lot," and, raising a serviette which lay
at the top of the basket, Ellice's eyes saw
a vision of food which made her mouth
water.  She capitulated at once, slid down
to the ground in a hurry, and attacked the
contents with avidity.  In a very few minutes
nothing but crumbs remained, and an empty
lemonade bottle.
</p>

<p>
"Now, shall we have a rest while I tell
you a story?" suggested Margaret.
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's hesitation, for of
all things Ellice loved better than another,
it was to listen to story-telling.  An eager
expression spread over her face for a moment,
then it darkened again.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going home," she muttered, and,
jumping up, she ran lightly down the avenue
a little way, then, turning into a denser
side-path, vanished.
</p>

<p>
"Defeated," said Margaret Woodford to
herself, with rather a sad little laugh.  "Ah,
well, I must try again.  I'm on the King's
service, I must never forget that, and victory
is of the Lord&mdash;of course, that applies in
every case."
</p>

<p>
It was not a very cheerful outlook for the
young governess, but she was determined to
win through if possible.
</p>

<p>
She did not see her charge again that
day.  Upon inquiring for her after her return
from the woods, she was informed she was
taking tea with her mother, and would not
be down again that evening.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Medhurst returned later, and she
managed to get a short interview with him,
and to obtain a more definite knowledge
as to what her supervision and powers with
regard to her pupil might mean.  She noticed
a worried expression come into his eyes as
she broached the subject.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Woodford, I am afraid I must
admit my little girl has been spoilt," he
answered.  "You understand my wife is not
strong&mdash;and&mdash;well, there it is&mdash;&mdash;" and he
spread his hands deprecatingly as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Does it mean I am to have full control?"
asked Margaret&mdash;"I mean in this way,"
she added.  "My pupil had no lessons
to-day; she ran away to the woods this morning
because I could not allow her to eat cake
instead of her breakfast, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm glad if you intervened in <i>that</i>
matter!  I have forbidden that," he answered
quickly.
</p>

<p>
"So I understood."
</p>

<p>
"And you supported the order?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and offended Ellice very deeply,
I'm afraid," laughed Margaret.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, you succeed if you get
your way.  Go on as you have begun, Miss
Woodford; I cannot suggest anything to
you, but"&mdash;lowering his voice&mdash;-"if you
can win my child and gain control over her,
I shall be more than grateful."
</p>

<p>
His manner was earnest, but Margaret
felt there was reservation when he paused
and suddenly changed the conversation.
The little she had gathered strengthened
her in her purpose.  There was evidently
trouble in this house which could not be
fully explained.
</p>

<p>
She went to bed that night puzzled, but
determined to try and do her duty
whatever the future might mean to her.
</p>

<p>
Ellice was like a different child at
breakfast the following morning.  She appeared
bubbling over with amiability and good
spirits, and even the presence of her
governess at the breakfast-table brought no
frowns or sulky looks.  Margaret's proposal
to take some lesson-books to the woods
was acceded to with apparent delight.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do let's, Miss Woodford!" she
exclaimed, clapping her hands with joy; in
fact, the suggestion was so novel, she forgot
for a little she was at enmity with her
governess.  The call of the woods was so
strong within her.
</p>

<p>
With a luncheon-basket and armed with
paper and pencils, governess and pupil set
out with enthusiasm for a beginning in the
path of knowledge.  They found the old
haunt in the oak, and sat down to work.
</p>

<p>
After a grind at reading and arithmetic,
Miss Woodford electrified her pupil by the
remark, "Now, shall we talk about the
trees?"
</p>

<p>
"About the trees?" repeated the child
in amazement.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, let me think what this old oak
has to say to us about himself; shut your
eyes and listen, and I will tell you
something of his story."
</p>

<p>
"I've lived such a long, long life,"
whispered the oak, "but although I'm getting
very old, I can remember the days when I
was young&mdash;more than two thousand years
ago"&mdash;(Ellice stirred as if to interrupt, but
the slight pressure of Margaret's fingers on
her arm made her relapse, and she breathlessly
listened to this wonderful statement)&mdash;"yes,
more than two thousand years
ago," insisted the oak, "I was planted just
here&mdash;a young sapling I was, strong and
sturdy, but small and tender, and had not
much knowledge of the world then.  But
that has all opened up in the centuries I've
lived, and I've seen wonderful changes, I
can tell you.
</p>

<p>
"There are not many of us left now, but
it's been handed down to me from my
forefathers that, right back to the times of the
ancient Britons, there was a grove of us
oaks in this very spot.  Those were the
times when we were thought a mighty lot
of by the poor heathen who dwelt in this
country then; they didn't know anything
about the true God, and so they worshipped
in their blindness the sun and the moon and
the stars and gods of their own creation.
Beside that, they counted all of us oak trees
sacred.  I don't know why that was, but
of course they couldn't help seeing we were
the finest-looking trees in all the forest, so
they took care of us and blessed us, and
even the mistletoe (the seed of which
sometimes drops upon us from a bird's mouth
and takes root and makes its home on our
boughs), even that the Druid priests used to
revere, and only allow it to be cut with
a golden knife at their sacrificial feasts.
</p>

<p>
"But though they were considerate for
us, they were very cruel to their enemies,
and often poor captives were brought out
and judged in the open courts in the woods,
and offered as sacrifices in our beautiful
shady oak groves.  Stories have been handed
down through past generations of those
poor people who suffered; but happier
times have come since.  Folks here don't
worship their cruel gods Woden and Thor
now, though they seem to keep them in
remembrance by still using Thursday and
Wednesday in their week's list of days, which
names mean, as I understand it, Thor's day
and Woden's day.
</p>

<p>
"I'm very glad those heathen times are
over here, and that the people who come
and rest in my trunk, or sit at my feet, know
about the wonderful true God Who created
everything for His glory; not only the boys
and girls, but in His Book it says, 'The
trees <i>of the Lord</i> are full of sap,' and I like
that&mdash;trees of the Lord; it shows we belong
to Him.  He doesn't forget us, either, for
He waters us with the rain which we suck
up into our roots, and drink into our leaves,
through the tiny mouths with which we
breathe the beautiful forest breezes, and by
the warm yellow sun the great God sends
the colour flushing into all our veins, and
into all the outer skin of the bark that covers
us.  Through our pores, which widen in the
hot weather, the sweet air rushes, and gives
us fresh life and growth, and under the tiny
air-bags are the canals where the sap runs
and rises in the spring, right from the very
roots, travelling over our branches until it
fills even our leaves, and makes us able to
put forth new growth and life.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, God is the gardener of the forest,
summer and winter, year in and year out.
He gives us all the power we need.  When
the time of singing birds comes, then a
whisper and hum runs through the whole
of the forest, and all the big tree world wakes
from sleep.  Everyone is drowsy at first&mdash;some
seem almost dead&mdash;but gradually we
open our eyes and cover our naked limbs,
and get out our summer dress, and shake
our leafy garments in the sunshine, while
the forest folk build new homes in our
branches and utter their thoughts of
praise."  The oak paused.
</p>

<p>
"We must stop story-telling now," said
Margaret; "it is lunch-time."
</p>

<p>
"No, no&mdash;go on&mdash;oh, do, please go on,
Miss Woodford!"
</p>

<p>
"Not now, dear; it's later than I
thought," glancing at her wrist-watch&mdash;"and
besides, it seems to be getting dark;
I think a storm is coming.  We must hurry
home."
</p>

<p>
"Not yet.  It doesn't matter if it rains."
</p>

<p>
"I think it does; anyway, we must go.
Come along quickly."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you <i>are</i> nasty!" muttered the child,
her bright face clouding over, and the former
spirit of antagonism returning.
</p>

<p>
However, she said no more, perhaps because
she saw it was useless.  She had at
last come upon someone whose will was
as strong, or stronger than her own.  Well,
she could afford to wait until the afternoon,
when she would be reinforced.  An
unpleasant smile curled her lips as she
remembered again with glee that to-day was
Saturday: the absorption of the story-telling
had meant a short obliteration of that fact,
but it suddenly returned with added force.
</p>

<p>
The two had a smart run at the finish
of their walk, for the storm burst above
them suddenly.  There was a vivid flash
of lightning, followed instantly by a crash
that rolled and echoed through the forest,
waking a hundred voices in its depths; then
down came the rain, in a perfect deluge.
</p>

<p>
As they entered the front door later, wet
through, they encountered Mr. Medhurst
just discarding his mackintosh.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you've been caught, I see!  Pretty
big storm," he remarked to Margaret.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we are soaked," answered Miss
Woodford.  "Come, Ellice, hurry and get
changed."
</p>

<p>
"I shan't bother," was the sharp answer;
"things will soon dry."
</p>

<p>
"Go at once, child!  Don't stand and talk
about it; do as you are told, girlie"&mdash;and
Margaret gently took the little girl's arm,
and led her towards the stairs.
</p>

<p>
Her father was about to hang up his
mackintosh; he paused; then as governess
and pupil went to their rooms, a smile of
quiet satisfaction touched his lips, as he
hung the garment upon the peg, and turned
and entered the dining-room.
</p>

<p>
A quarter of an hour later there was a
violent ring at the front-door bell, then a
noisy stampede as someone entered with
a good deal of clatter, and some eager
questioning of James, as the man shut out
the swish of rain and wind which with the
newcomer rushed into the hall.
</p>

<p>
"I say, got another?" asked a boy's
voice.  "Tall and scraggy and glasses, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you are referring to the
governess, Master Bob?" said James gravely,
but with a slightly suppressed smile flickering
in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I am! &mdash;I say, what is she like,
though?"
</p>

<p>
"You'd better wait till you see her for
yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Anyway, it means a little fun," continued
the boy.  "She won't be here long,
that's pretty certain," and he commenced
to whistle an airy tune as he made to enter
the dining-room.
</p>

<p>
"Stop that noise, and sit down quietly,"
said his father irritably.  "You are late
as usual, I see."  Further remark was cut
short by Ellice rushing into the room and
boisterously greeting her brother, followed
more gently by Margaret, who paused
in astonishment at the sight of the
boy of whose existence she had not even
heard.
</p>

<p>
"We've brought our luncheon home to-day,
we didn't stay to eat it in the woods,
and the tarts are all sloppy," exclaimed
Ellice, lying glibly.  "You can have them.
Bob," anxious to shock Margaret, her voice
shrill with excitement.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you for nothing," answered her brother.
</p>

<p>
"This is my son, Miss Woodford.  You see
the specimen he is," said Mr. Medhurst, by
way of introduction.  "I wonder if you
remember the advice of an old sage, 'When
you see a boy, beat him, because he has
either just done something wrong, is doing it,
or just going to do it.'  Now I've told you
this young man's character in one sentence."
</p>

<p>
The words were said smilingly, but the
smile was ironical.
</p>

<p>
The boy's bright face clouded, and Margaret
felt what a tactless mistake the introduction
had been, and wondered at the denseness
and unkindness of the remarks.
</p>

<p>
She turned to Bob pleasantly as she held
out her hand.
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe in very bad boys&mdash;I
never came across any, and if I did, I shouldn't
ask others for their character, Mr. Medhurst,"
she replied; "I should judge them for myself."
</p>

<p>
"Wait till you know this one better, Miss
Woodford," he answered; and then, turning
to Bob: "How about your report," he
continued; "did you bring it home?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir," answered the boy sullenly.
</p>

<p>
"Tore it up, I suppose, on purpose?"
</p>

<p>
"Y-e-s," came the reply, slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, you know the consequences."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, daddy; wait till he's done
something <i>more</i>," interposed Ellice, dancing
round her father, and grasping his arm
persuasively.
</p>

<p>
His face at once softened.
</p>

<p>
"You think it won't be long before the
trouble comes, eh?" he asked, pinching
her cheek gently.  His small daughter always
seemed able to disarm his wrath.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;at least&mdash;I&mdash;mean&mdash;&mdash;" she stammered.
</p>

<p>
"All right, old lady, I understand," he
answered, smiling; then, turning to Margaret,
"Women's wiles, Miss Woodford.  Well, you
are let off this time, young man," turning
to his son; "you can thank your sister for
it," and with this he left them.
</p>

<p>
For a few moments silence prevailed, and
then Ellice, catching hold of her brother's
arm, whispered:
</p>

<p>
"Come on up to the schoolroom; I've
heaps to tell you."
</p>

<p>
Margaret refrained from following them,
to avoid hearing their confidences, and still
bewildered by the discovery of this new
addition to the family, which might mean
further problems for herself, with a little
sigh of relief picked up a book and made
her way to a quiet cosy seat in the drawing-room.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
TRIALS
</h3>

<p>
Ellice Medhurst was full of mystery
and excitement as she dragged Bob
towards the staircase, anxious to escape
observation, leading him to the seclusion
of the schoolroom, where they could talk
undisturbedly of the new inmate of
Oaklands, who had arrived there since Bob's
last week-end at home.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I say, I <i>do</i> detest her," said Ellice,
as she sprang on to the table, placing her
feet upon a chair and her face in her hands
supported by her arms, her elbows resting
upon her knees.
</p>

<p>
"She <i>looks</i> pretty decent," remarked Bob;
"she is a sight better than the one who has
just gone.  I say, what a shock I gave <i>her</i>,
didn't I?  She howled like a hyena."
</p>

<p>
A shout of laughter rippled from his small
sister as a memory, mutually considered
humorous, roused this expression of mirth.
</p>

<p>
"I can see her <i>now</i> dancing about, and
shrieking, 'Help!&mdash;Help!&mdash;Burglars!' as if
she was being killed," continued Bob,
spluttering with amusement.
</p>

<p>
"And when&mdash;you&mdash;came&mdash;and offered to
call father," put in Ellice&mdash;"saying, 'What's
all this?  Whatever is the matter?'  I just
rushed back into my room and buried my
head in the pillows for fear she'd hear me
laughing, and guess.  Just fancy, Bob, if
she had?  Wouldn't daddy have been
angry?"  And as she finished, a more sober
expression came upon her face as she pictured
unpleasant possibilities.
</p>

<p>
"If you don't act the little idiot by laughing,
no one will guess," answered the boy.
</p>

<p>
"I won't&mdash;I promise I won't," she answered.
</p>

<p>
"But I say, do you <i>want</i> this one to go?"
continued Bob.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I do.  I don't mean to have
a governess at all; I said I wouldn't, and I
<i>won't</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you are a bit of a fool.  Nice
dunce you'll be when you grow up," came
the brotherly response.
</p>

<p>
"I shan't," flashed Ellice.  "I can read
all right, and when I get older I'll just study,
myself.  What's the use of all the silly old
arithmetic and stuff?"
</p>

<p>
"Very well, only don't blame me when
you <i>are</i> grown up," answered Bob loftily.
</p>

<p>
"As if I should.  Come on; let's fix
things," and, creeping softly out on to the
landing, and reconnoitring on the staircase,
the two stole up to Miss Woodford's room.
</p>

<p>
Ellice kept guard outside, while Bob
evidently fixed matters to their mutual
satisfaction.  It only took a few moments, and
the culprits were back again in their own
quarters, their plans duly arranged.
</p>

<p>
Ellice was wild with delight at the prospect
of anticipated fun, as she called it; but in
the back of Bob's head there was a little
sense of doubt and discomfort.
</p>

<p>
"She seemed so jolly decent," he muttered
to himself; "I hope she won't be awfully
frightened.  I think you are a little beast to
do it to her, Ellice."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you don't know her like I do!  She
was horrid to me, and I'll just pay her out,"
replied the child.
</p>

<p>
"All right then.  Now shut up about it
till to-night."
</p>

<p>
With this the conspirators went down,
ready to behave in an exemplary fashion at
tea-time, to disarm suspicion.
</p>

<p>
Margaret was tired that night in spite of
her rest in the afternoon; it was a heavy,
slumbrous day, thunder still threatened, and
the atmosphere seemed waiting for the
refreshment of a cool breeze which might,
it was hoped, spring up in the night.  It
seemed too hot to sleep, and it was quite
a long time before Morpheus closed Margaret's
lids, and led her into the land of dreams.
</p>

<p>
It was still dark when she was roused
into semi-consciousness by something which
at first her senses hardly grasped, then, as
full wakefulness came to her, she became
cognisant of a soft scraping noise in her
room, as if someone might be in her vicinity.
She was startled for a few moments, and
her heart quickened its beating, as now, fully
alert, she listened intently, anxious to discover
the reason of the unusual sounds.
</p>

<p>
This house had held many surprises for
her, and she was not quite satisfied in her
own mind as to the kind of post she had
accepted; but Margaret Woodford was no
coward, and therefore she never dreamt of
screaming, or getting into a panic, although
the noise, which continued at intervals,
seemed to come from the ground near
her, and each moment to become more
distinct.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly her tension ceased; she had
caught the sound of muffled voices outside
her room, and in an instant she realised the
circumstances.  Perhaps her face at that
moment would have surprised the culprits
outside if they could have seen the hot
indignation which surged into it.  She waited
a little until it died down and she felt calmer,
and then, as quietly and stealthily as the
enemy, she crept out of bed, and, without
lighting the gas, donned her dressing-gown,
and, ignoring further preparation, flung the
door wide open!
</p>

<p>
"What are you children doing here?"
she asked quietly.
</p>

<p>
There was the instant flight of a small
figure in white, and then Bob, who was
stooping down to the floor jerking a string,
the end of which issued from under the rug
on the landing&mdash;Bob, with all the blood
in his body seeming to be rushing to his
head, rose to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you've tied that to a can under
my bed, I suppose?" said Miss Woodford
witheringly&mdash;"hoping to frighten me?  And
<i>this</i> is the way you treat lady visitors to
your home?  And you call yourself a
<i>gentleman</i>, I presume?"  The tones were
scathing&mdash;how scathing Margaret scarcely
realised herself.  "And with childish
tricks of this kind," she continued, "you
encourage your silly little sister in
insubordination."
</p>

<p>
The door of Ellice's room stood open, and
she was listening to every word&mdash;"<i>silly
little sister</i>."  She writhed as she heard the
epithet applied to herself; she had felt so
clever and important just before, and now
she dived under the clothes, cringing with
mortification.  The sarcastic contempt in
Miss Woodford's voice was far worse than
the severest punishment Bob had ever endured,
and he felt covered with confusion and
disgust at his invidious position.
</p>

<p>
"Go&mdash;go to your bedroom at once,"
finished Margaret, "and see that you don't
cause any further trouble."
</p>

<p>
At this moment Mr. Medhurst opened
his door, and inquired if anything was the
matter.  "Now I shall get it," thought
Bob to himself; but he was mistaken.
Margaret had spoken in low tones up to
now, being most anxious the master of the
house should not be disturbed.  She was
fighting her own battle in her own way,
and did not need any court of appeal at
present.
</p>

<p>
"Bob and I both heard a slight noise,
Mr. Medhurst," she answered.  "But it seems
quiet enough now.  I don't think there is
anything the matter really."
</p>

<p>
"Cats, perhaps," he answered, smiling;
"they do come up these stairs at night
sometimes.  You are not nervous, I hope,
Miss Woodford?"
</p>

<p>
"Not in the least," she answered.  "I
think we can all go to bed again satisfied."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that's sensible," he replied, adding,
as he was in the act of closing his door, "I
am glad you came down to reassure Miss
Woodford, Bob.  I expect you remembered
Miss Warner was alarmed in the same way."
</p>

<p>
Margaret stole a glance at the boy, but he
would not raise his eyes to hers, but instead he
turned swiftly and fled up to his room.  She
smiled to herself as she closed her door,
then with a little sigh of weariness returned
to her slumbers.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
INFLUENCE
</h3>

<p>
Sunday dawned fair and sweet.  A
sharp shower during the night had
freshened the garden and watered the
parched ground, which had drunk the
moisture up greedily, carrying it down to
the roots of the grass and already bringing
back the resurrection colour to the brown
dried blades in the meadows.
</p>

<p>
Breakfast passed away without incident.
Beyond the usual morning greeting, the
young people remained very quiet, and gave
only monosyllabic answers to Margaret's
attempts at conversation.
</p>

<p>
Ellice was doubtful as to the consequences
of last night's escapade; it was one sign
of triumph for the new governess that the
child was already growing uneasy, uncertain
of herself.  She had an affectionate nature
really, and it cost her something to steel
her heart so persistently against this certainly
interesting looking girl who had come to
teach her.  If Ellice had spoken the truth,
she could have owned what she would not
admit to herself, that she was longing to
make friends, and to get a chance of hearing
more stories; but having vaunted the fact
to James and Betsy that she never meant
to have a governess, the cost to her pride
prevented her from giving in.
</p>

<p>
Miss Woodford guessed her attitude of
mind, and was determined to wait patiently,
although she had been tempted more than
once to resign the post; but&mdash;and there was
always that but&mdash;if this was the chosen
work to which she was called, there must
be no truckling with a faint heart.  No
looking back after once having put her
hand to the plough, however heavy the
furrows might prove, or long and dreary
the appointed task.
</p>

<p>
Bob ate his breakfast in the greatest
discomfort; he was really burning with a
sense of shame, and making up his mind
to an unpleasant duty.
</p>

<p>
The meal over, Margaret left the house
and wandered out into the garden.  It was
a dear old-fashioned place, with grassy paths
bowered with pergolas of roses.  Great hedges
of tangerine and amethyst pea-blooms filled
the air with sweetness.  Hollyhocks leaned
their tall stems against the ancient garden
wall, the old brickwork&mdash;a dream of subdued
colour&mdash;forming a rich background to the
brilliant hues of the flowers.
</p>

<p>
Margaret drank it all in with a breath of
delight.  The place was rife with roses raising
their heads in the sunshine, cooled by the
dew-drops glistening on their petals.  Zinneas
in all shades, and geraniums in massed
pinks and scarlet, lined the borders, with
gleams of orange eschscholtzia and dainty
violas all stretching upward to the golden
glory of the sky, while around them fluttered
the butterflies, and to Margaret's ears came
the sweet hot sound of the song of the
humming bees and the murmur of insects
talking in the grass.
</p>

<p>
The girl herself gave just the needed
touch of human life to intensify the charm of
the scene as she stood looking down at the
wealth of flowers.  One thought filled her
mind with a thrill of praise to the Giver of
all good, "How can anyone see these wonders
of creation, and catch the sweet fragrance of
roses, and doubt God's love, I wonder?
Every flower that blooms proves that."
</p>

<p>
Unconsciously the thought filling her heart
had been spoken aloud, and Bob, coming
softly down the grassy path, approaching
her unheard, caught the words and paused
a moment, his attention drawn for the first
time in his life to the beauty of nature, and
the love message it brings.
</p>

<p>
Margaret was aroused by a voice at her
elbow saying a little nervously:
</p>

<p>
"Can I speak to you, Miss Woodford?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's Bob!  Certainly!" she answered,
an inviting ring in her voice.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I'm awfully sorry about last night&mdash;I
want you&mdash;to&mdash;know," he said hesitatingly,
his face crimson with shame.  "Will you try
to&mdash;to forget it?" he stammered.
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course!" answered Margaret.
"I shall never think of it again."
</p>

<p>
"I feel such a beastly cad," he finished.
</p>

<p>
"Well, for the future remember you are
a gentleman, Bob, and that '<i>manners makyth
man</i>,' and you will find it easier to behave
as one.  And shall we make up our minds
to be friends?" she added, holding out her
hand with a winning smile.  "Come, what do
you say?"
</p>

<p>
"Rather!" answered the boy, and then,
breaking away, rushed with lightning speed
to the house.
</p>

<p>
Later in the day Margaret came upon the
young people uninterestedly turning over
the leaves of story-books, weary of
themselves and each other, and not on speaking
terms.  She had appeared upon the scene
at the close of a heated argument, in which
Ellice considered Bob had turned traitor by
taking up the cudgels on Margaret's behalf.
</p>

<p>
When he left her so hurriedly in the
morning, Margaret hoped she had gained ground
with him; but she little knew that the
interview meant a big victory, and that
Bob Medhurst's allegiance was won for all
time.
</p>

<p>
Now, as she looked at the two, she
ventured:
</p>

<p>
"I have a proposal.  What do you say to
taking our tea to the woods, and then I'll
tell you a story, if you like?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes&mdash;yes," exclaimed Ellice, full of
animation at once, and forgetful of all her
former animosity.
</p>

<p>
"Come along then," said Margaret; "let's
get a basket from Betsy."
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes everything was prepared,
and the three set off for Wychfield Glade.
</p>

<p>
It was a perfect afternoon, and Margaret's
heart felt lighter as they followed the mossy
path which led through the forest to the
avenue.  Bob's manner showed a subtle
change:
</p>

<p>
"Please let me carry that for you, Miss
Woodford," he said shyly, holding out his
hand for the tea-basket.
</p>

<p>
"It's awfully heavy," remarked his small
sister, in a loud whisper.
</p>

<p>
He brushed the remark aside with a look
which said plainly, "You shut up."
</p>

<p>
Margaret accepted the offer with a smile
of thanks as she gave up the burden.
</p>

<p>
"It's very nice to have a gentleman to
help one," she said quietly.
</p>

<p>
The boy coloured slightly.  After all, he
was his father's son, and knew the attitude
of a young savage was unworthy of him, and
the role not really satisfactory to himself,
although he was not aware that one of the
commands of God given in His Word is "Be
courteous."
</p>

<p>
It was quite good fun hunting for wood
and arranging a gipsy fire to boil the kettle.
</p>

<p>
Finding it was too early for tea, Ellice
clamoured for the promised story.
</p>

<p>
"A fairy one," she demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Not to-day, dear," was the answer.
</p>

<p>
"Why?" asked the child vexedly.
</p>

<p>
"Because it's Sunday, and we might
think of something more useful."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, bother! we don't want a Sunday
one.  Miss Warner tried to make us read a
Bible chapter when she was here.  We
wouldn't, so she read one out loud, and
then asked us questions.  We didn't answer,
did we, Bob?"
</p>

<p>
"No," replied Bob shortly, but he didn't
look at Miss Woodford as he made the
admission.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it <i>was</i> dry," continued Ellice, "and
we didn't understand it.  You are not going
to do anything like that, are you?" and the
child's voice sounded a little entreatingly
as she put the question.
</p>

<p>
"No," Margaret answered, with a smile.
"I want to tell you a little bit about the
life of a boy whom we read of in the Bible;
there is nothing dry in the whole of his
history, at least I don't think so.  You can
tell me what <i>you</i> think afterwards, if you
like."
</p>

<p>
Ellice seemed satisfied with this, and with
a good grace settled down to listen.  Bob
showed no sign either way as to whether he
was interested or not.
</p>

<p>
The hush of the forest was all about them,
the wind whispered in the branches of the
trees, insects chirped gaily in the
undergrowth, and birds and squirrels held busy
conclave around their homesteads, but there
was nothing to interrupt Margaret Woodford
as she began her Sunday talk.
</p>

<p>
"At an old country house in Kent, when
it was under repair, and the workmen were
putting down a new floor, in one of the top
rooms, underneath the worn-out boards, they
found a letter dated 1600, one that had been
written to those who lived there centuries
before.  The letter was so discoloured with
age, that although the men who unearthed
it stopped their work and stood looking at
it for some time, they were disappointed to
find they were unable to read any of its
contents.  But they could not help wondering
who wrote it, and what it was all about.
</p>

<p>
"Now in your home you have got some
much older letters than that one.  They
were written to a young man nearly 2,000
years ago, and you can decipher every word
of them, and know where they were sent
from, and to whom they were written, and
a great deal in connection with the writer.
They are such interesting letters that I want
to tell you something about them, and then
you can read them for yourselves.
</p>

<p>
"Nearly two thousand years ago there
lived in a village in Asia Minor, called Lystra,
an old Jewish woman named Lois, and
living with her was her daughter Eunice,
and her husband who was a Greek, and
probably therefore a heathen; and also
their little son, a boy named Timothy, and
this boy was the one who had those wonderful
old letters you have got at home, written
to him, all those long, long years ago.  You
will find them in your Bible; they are called
the First and Second Book of Timothy.
</p>

<p>
"Now, in God's Word we are told something
of what kind of a boy Timothy was,
and I think if you and I had known him
then, we should have been able to say, 'He's
not a bad sort,' because he grew up to be a
very brave man, and a brave man generally
means a plucky boy, doesn't it?  We all
of us despise cowards, don't we?  And so
I think we should have liked Timothy."
</p>

<p>
Bob nodded assent, and even Ellice was
interested, although the story was a Sunday
one!
</p>

<p>
"Timothy's home was in a town in the
country of Lycaonia," continued Margaret.
"The district round it is rather desolate and
bare of trees, and as it was not a very big
place, I expect it was fairly quiet.
</p>

<p>
"Timothy would be busy learning lessons
in those days, and, among other things, he
was taught by his grandmother and his
mother the stories in the Old Testament,
a great part of which Jewish boys had to
learn by heart.  One day a great excitement
happened in the village, a missionary
travelling through the country stopped at
Lystra to preach the Gospel, which means
good news, that Jesus Christ, the Son of
God (Who had lately been put to death at
Jerusalem), was <i>their</i> God and Saviour, Who
had died and risen from the dead, and gone
back to Heaven, and would forgive all their
sins, and help them to live for Him, and
afterwards receive them into His glory.
</p>

<p>
"That <i>was</i> good news, and if Lois and
Eunice went to hear that Gospel preaching,
as I think they did, I know they must have
enjoyed it, for we also know that later they
both became Christians.  The missionary,
who came to preach at Lystra, was really
the Great Apostle, St. Paul.
</p>

<p>
"We can picture the boy Timothy standing
among the crowd, probably listening to this
new teacher, when presently St. Paul caught
the earnest eyes of a poor lame man gazing
at him, with an expression which seemed
to convey to him that he believed all he was
saying, and could trust the power of this
Great God Whom he preached&mdash;the Lord
Jesus.  And Paul, '<i>perceiving he had faith
to be healed, said with a loud voice, "Stand
upright on thy feet."  And he leaped and
walked.</i>' (Acts. xiv. 9-10.)
</p>

<p>
"Then the poor, ignorant people, when
they saw what was done, cried out, '<i>The
gods are come down to us in the likeness of
men.</i>'  And Barnabas, who was with
St. Paul, and was the elder of the two men,
they called Jupiter, and the Great Apostle
by the name of Jupiter's son, Mercurius&mdash;you
know, of course, there are no real gods
of those names, only the One true God we
worship.
</p>

<p>
"But these poor heathen did not know
that, so their priest brought garlands to
crown the Apostles, and oxen to sacrifice to
them, and St. Paul and Barnabas were
dreadfully distressed, and rent their clothes
(a thing Eastern people used to do to show
their distress), and ran among them,
exclaiming, '<i>Sirs, why do ye these things?  We
also are men of like passions with you, and
preach unto you that ye should turn from
these vanities unto the living God, Which made
heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things
that are therein: Who in times past suffered
all nations to walk in their own ways.  Nevertheless
He left not Himself without witness, in
that He did good, and gave us rain from heaven,
and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with
food and gladness.</i>'
</p>

<p>
"'<i>And with these sayings scarce restrained
they the people, that they had not done sacrifice
unto them.</i>' (Acts xiv. 15-18.)
</p>

<p>
"What a commotion there must have
been in the village, the people crying out
that the gods had come down from the
sky to speak to them, and rushing to help
the priest to drive the animal to sacrifice,
and bring the garlands to crown the
missionaries.  Perhaps the boy Timothy saw
all this.  I think he must have, as it happened
near his home, and if so, how interested he
would be when St. Paul explained to them
about the One true God Timothy had read
about in the old Jewish law books&mdash;the Old
Testament, which had taught him, that
'God made the heaven and earth, the sea
and all that therein is.'  And if Timothy
listened on those other days when St. Paul
preached, he must have learned too that
the Great God he knew, was Jesus Christ,
Who had died on Calvary, and would save
him from his sins and help him to lead a
Christian life.
</p>

<p>
"There was something else which happened
at Lystra a few days after the Gospel
preaching: some men came to the village from
Antioch and stirred up the people of Lystra
against St. Paul, and persuaded them so
strongly against him, that they took up
stones and tried to stone him to death.
When St. Paul was writing to the Corinthian
people long after, and telling them about
his life and its sorrows, he said, '<i>Thrice was
I beaten with rods, once was I stoned.</i>'  (2
Cor. xi. 25.)  And that was the time we have
just been talking about.
</p>

<p>
"We can imagine Timothy rushing into
the house and crying out, 'Oh, mother,
mother, they are stoning the great preacher
to death!' and possibly his grandmother
and Eunice running back with him to learn
all that was happening.
</p>

<p>
"We know that St. Paul became unconscious,
and was dragged out of the city and
left by his enemies for dead.  But presently
the disciples&mdash;the Christians who loved
him&mdash;saw him recover consciousness, and he
was able to stand up, and went into the
city, and the next day left the town with
Barnabas, and went to Derbe.  But only
for a little while, for he soon returned again
to Lystra, and visited the Christians there,
talking to them and persuading them to
try and be very brave.  I think it was no
doubt that then Timothy gave up his heart
to Jesus Christ, and decided to become his
faithful soldier and servant to his life's end.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I go on?" said Margaret, appealing
to Ellice directly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, please&mdash;I think I like it," answered
the little girl.
</p>

<p>
With a smile Margaret continued:
</p>

<p>
"I said just now that Timothy was a
plucky boy; I'll tell you why I think so.
It is not pleasant to be laughed at for our
religion, is it?  We need a little courage
when that happens; but think what it meant
to Timothy to be a Christian.  He not only
risked being made fun of by other Jewish
boys in Lystra, but he stood a chance of
being put to death by the heathen, the
worshippers of Jupiter, who lived in the
same town with himself.
</p>

<p>
"When he was a little older, he joined
St. Paul, and went with him on some of
his preaching-tours, and was ordained a
minister of the Gospel, and was arrested
in Rome and made a prisoner just because
he was a believer in Jesus Christ.  We
read in the Bible about his release from
prison.
</p>

<p>
"Later he came to Ephesus, and was
made Bishop of that great city while he
was still a young man, and in St. Paul's first
letter to him he writes and tells him how to
manage his congregation; and to tell all
the children to be good to their fathers and
mothers, and as they get older to try and
return some of the care they have received
from them, by helping them all they can.
He says, '<i>Let the children show kindness at
home, and requite their parents, for that is
good and acceptable with God.</i>'
</p>

<p>
"And then he tells Timothy what he is
to be like himself: how he is to show the
world&mdash;that is, all in his own home, all
in his congregations, all in that great heathen
city&mdash;that he is really and truly a follower
of Jesus Christ.  He says, '<i>Let no man
despise thy youth; but be thou an example of
the believers, in word, conversation, charity,
spirit, faith, purity.</i>'  Six things, you see,
in which Timothy could <i>prove</i> his Christianity;
six things God wanted of him; six things
God expects of <i>us</i> if we are His soldiers and
servants.  It's no use our saying we love
Him, unless we prove it to Him by our
lives.  I want you two, Bob and Ellice, to
think about that for yourselves.  Will <i>you</i>
love the Lord Jesus Christ?&mdash;will you have
Him for your King?"
</p>

<p>
The two appealed to so directly made no
answer, but although there was silence, the
question had gone home.
</p>

<p>
"If so," continued Margaret, "<i>prove</i> you
are in earnest, for God says, 'If ye love Me,
keep My commandments.'"
</p>

<p>
There was silence for a little.  Ellice moved
uneasily, but Bob sat gazing thoughtfully
down the avenue, a new expression of seriousness
on his merry face.  He was a schoolboy,
and not keen on pi talk, but this was different
from anything he had heard before.  Miss
Woodford again took up the thread of the
story.
</p>

<p>
"Now, how was Timothy to prove the
reality of his religion in <i>Truth</i>?  He was to
speak the truth, be honest and honourable
in <i>all</i> he said; that was what it meant.  Think
of that next time you are tempted to tell
a lie&mdash;will you?  God despises lies, He hates
them, He calls them an abomination&mdash;which
is a big strong word, isn't it?
</p>

<p>
"I know a boy who knew he could not be
found out if he told a lie as to the time he
had spent preparing his lessons, saying he
had given an hour's study to them, because
his master would accept his word whatever
he said; but if he admitted he had only given
ten minutes to it, he would be punished.
Yet that boy, when he was asked, 'Did
you give half an hour to this lesson as I told
you?' answered, 'No, sir.'
</p>

<p>
"'How long then?'
</p>

<p>
"'A few minutes, sir.'
</p>

<p>
"The punishment followed, but when it
was over, the boy was happy with a clear
conscience&mdash;far happier than if he had lied.
</p>

<p>
"That boy wasn't a prig&mdash;a namby-pamby
sort; he was a thorough-going, sporting
Christian, the same sort as Timothy must
have been.  The sort God wants.
</p>

<p>
"A Christian in <i>word</i>.  In conversation.
</p>

<p>
"We are to be examples of Christians
in all we say.  Are we always?  We
fail by exaggerating things sometimes,
don't we?  Perhaps we declare we hate
people when we only don't like them
much."
</p>

<p>
Ellice coloured consciously.
</p>

<p>
"I know another boy," went on Margaret,
"who, when his school-fellows were talking
nasty talk, not only wouldn't join in, but
said to the others, 'Shut up, we won't have
anything of that sort here,' and by his
influence stopped it.  Even if he hadn't
succeeded, in trying he was doing what
God wanted, wasn't he?"
</p>

<p>
Bob nodded thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"We must also show we are Christians, in
charity&mdash;that is, love.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it a rule in all bands of the Boy
Scouts, or at least in some, that everyone
should do a kind action, at least once a
day?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I've heard of that," said Bob.
</p>

<p>
"It's a good rule.  Supposing we three
begin to-day to try and follow it.
</p>

<p>
"In the paper some time ago, I read, a
Boy Scout saw the wind blow over a whole
bale of goods outside a draper's shop, and
immediately, to fulfil his duty&mdash;not to get
a tip&mdash;he crossed the road, set to work to
pick everything up, put it straight, and then
went happily on his way.  That boy was
obeying God's command of love.
</p>

<p>
"We are also to prove our Christianity
by <i>Our Faith</i>.  A little girl told her clergyman
<i>she</i> knew she was a Christian, because
she had asked the Lord Jesus to blot out
all her sins, and to give her a new heart and
save her.  The minister asked her, 'How
do you know Jesus heard you and saved
you?'  She answered, 'Because He has
promised to do it in the Bible, and I am
sure <i>He cannot break His promise</i>.'  In
that answer she showed she had faith, she
believed in God, and what He would do
for her.
</p>

<p>
"There is one more thing mentioned in
Timothy's letter which God wants of us.
We are to be Christians, in purity.
</p>

<p>
"Not only are we not to say impure, or
nasty words, but we are not to do nasty
things.  God is always watching, never forget
it, and He says '<i>Be ye holy, even as I am
holy.</i>'  And if we think <i>how</i> pure God is,
Who cannot sin, we shall see how pure He
wants us to try to be, and He will certainly
give us strength to resist all such temptations
it we ask Him.
</p>

<p>
"I have read of a boy who was being
tempted to sin.  His persecutor said, 'I will
beat you to death if you do not give up
this religion which makes you refuse to do
wrong.'  The boy answered, 'I would rather
be beaten to death than offend the Lord
Jesus.'
</p>

<p>
"The brave answer made his persecutor
release him, and not only that, but he began
to think there must be some great strength
about these Christians that they are able
to resist evil.  Get your Bibles out to-night,
and read for yourselves 1 Timothy iv. 11, 12,
a bit of Timothy's old letter, and remember
God has sent it to you both, not only to
tell you about him, but how to grow like
him, and be a good follower of the King of
kings."
</p>

<p>
"Did Timothy stick to it all, Miss Woodford?"
asked Bob interestedly.
</p>

<p>
"History answers 'yes,' for years after,
when he was at Ephesus, a very wicked
city, where the inhabitants were given up
to idolatry, superstition, and sin, one day
when he was preaching to a great crowd,
they set upon him in their heathen fury and
killed him.  So you see this brave man,
who must always have lived in danger of
losing his life, this plucky boy, died a martyr's
death&mdash;and so gave up his life for the Saviour
he had loved so long."
</p>

<p>
The story was finished, and no one spoke
for a little while.  Ellice moved away to
gather wild flowers, and Bob busied himself
throwing acorns at the birds.  Presently
he said quietly:
</p>

<p>
"I should have liked to have known that
chap, Miss Woodford; seems a pity he's dead."
</p>

<p>
"And yet alive, Bob, for evermore.  Perhaps
you will know him in that other life&mdash;choose
the same King?" she said softly.  "Think
what an interesting world the next life
means, and the number of Old Testament
people, as well as New Testament ones, we
shall meet&mdash;and, above all, Bob, live in the
company of the Lord Himself."
</p>

<p>
"Umph!&mdash;I can fancy them all marching
singing up to the throne, but I don't think
I&mdash;shall&mdash;ever get in; I shall never be fit."
</p>

<p>
The boy's voice was husky as he said
these words, then he turned over and lay
face downwards on the ground.
</p>

<p>
"<i>If we confess our sins He is faithful and
just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us
from all unrighteousness,</i>" said Margaret.
"You see, He has promised, and He never
fails us, though we often disappoint
Him&mdash;ask Him for yourself"; and with this
Margaret went to join Ellice, just pleading
silently in her own heart that the Holy
Spirit of God would plant and water the seed
she had tried to sow, and cause it to spring
up into everlasting life.
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later, when she and Ellice
returned with a basket full of wild flowers
and fern roots, there was no trace of
seriousness about Bob; he just seemed
overflowing with fun.  Margaret wondered;
but she knew how to leave all results with
God.
</p>

<p>
The tea was a merry one&mdash;once only Ellice
tried to be disobedient.  To her utter surprise
Bob said sharply: "Shut up, and do what
you are told, and don't worry Miss Woodford."
</p>

<p>
Sheer astonishment held Ellice silent.  It
looked as if her best supporter was quite going
over to the enemy!
</p>

<p>
From her bedroom window Mrs. Medhurst
watched the trio, when they started out to
the woods, with an air of surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Do look, Gordon!" she exclaimed; "Miss
Woodford has gone down the drive with
Ellice, and Bob has actually gone with
them."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Medhurst rose from his seat and
looked over his wife's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"I think I can congratulate you on your
choice of a governess this time, Lucille; it
really looks as if she'll stay"&mdash;and he laughed
as he spoke.  "Perhaps our youngsters are
not much worse than other people's after
all," he continued.  "You spoil Bob, and
I suppose we both spoil Ellice; let's
hope Miss Woodford will counteract the
mischief."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you are always hard on Bob, Gordon!
I can't think why."
</p>

<p>
"Hard, am I?  There seems a good deal
of necessity, I think; but there, I confess I
don't understand boys."
</p>

<p>
"I wish I was strong; I would love to
have taken them out with me like that,"
said Mrs. Medhurst; she spoke wistfully,
with a far-away look of unrest in her dark
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You might do a little more.  You could
if you tried, don't you think?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't&mdash;go&mdash;out," she said wearily,
"but I like my flowers."
</p>

<p>
"The garden has done well, hasn't it?"
he said.  "I did just what you suggested,
dear, simply massed all the brightest colours
together, and, as you say, Nature seems to
be her own best artist, and makes them
blend perfectly.  You must come with me
this evening and see what the rain has done.
Now have a rest until tea-time."
</p>

<p>
He arranged his wife's cushions with deft
fingers as of a nurse, and Mrs. Medhurst lay
down again upon her couch, while her
husband resumed his reading.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
THE GREAT FIGHT
</h3>

<p>
Margaret was quite sorry when Bob
departed on Monday morning to
school, for although nothing further was
said to assure her, his attitude towards her
was evidently changed, and she believed she
was now upon a friendly footing with the
boy, and at least one of the difficulties of
Oaklands was partially overcome.
</p>

<p>
The days that intervened before his return
upon the following Saturday were not of
the happiest.  She determined to insist upon
her charge having special hours for study,
and for recreation, and this meant a struggle
of wills.  Ellice had hitherto had her own
way entirely, and any curtailing of that met
strenuous opposition.
</p>

<p>
Monday morning was a lesson in patience
to Margaret.  Ellice came willingly to the
schoolroom, and condescended (for that was
her attitude) to give her mind to lessons for
about half an hour.  For that length of
time she seemed docility itself.  Bob's words
as to her ignorance had rankled in her mind;
the child was full of pride, and the idea
of possibly being looked down upon as an
ignoramus later on was a detestable thought.
But half an hour every morning, she had
determined, would be sufficient for her
concentration.
</p>

<p>
She worked busily and happily at first, and
showed an intelligence which pleased her
teacher; then she grew a little restless, and
cast furtive glances at the clock.  Margaret
noticed the slackening of attention, but made
no remark.  An hour and a half she thought
would be sufficient for the first week's
morning's work: with such an undisciplined
pupil it might be wise to go slowly.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Ellice threw down her book.
</p>

<p>
"It's ten, Miss Woodford.  I've done
enough for this morning.  I don't want to
do any more."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you've only just begun!" said
Margaret quietly.  "You started at
half-past nine; at eleven we will put the lessons
away, and go into the woods, or orchard,
as you like."
</p>

<p>
"I know I'm not going to work until
eleven," was the impertinent reply.
</p>

<p>
Jumping up from her seat, the child made
for the door.  But her governess was too
quick for her.  Margaret had been fully on
the alert for a possible attempted escape,
and in a moment she intercepted the flight.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry, Ellice, but you cannot go
yet," she said firmly.  "Sit down, child,
and make the best of it; only an hour more,
and you will be free."
</p>

<p>
For the second time in her life astonishment
bereft Ellice of speech for a few seconds,
then her indignation vented itself in words
as she stamped her feet in her rage.
</p>

<p>
"I hate you!&mdash;I hate you!  I will go out
when I want to!' she stormed, tears of
passion shining in her eyes, and sobs half
choking her.
</p>

<p>
"Stop that noise at once, Ellice," said
Miss Woodford.  "I am ashamed of you.
Sit down, and understand you will remain
here for one hour longer as I said; but unless
you obey me now, it will be two."
</p>

<p>
With an abandonment of temper the
little girl flung herself into a chair, throwing
her arms across the table and hiding her
tear-scorched face in her hands.  There was
still the sound of suppressed, gasping sobs,
which gradually died down into silence.  It
almost appeared that, wearied out with her
own temper, she had fallen asleep.
</p>

<p>
No sound now disturbed the quiet of
the schoolroom, but the tick-tock of the
clock on the mantelshelf.  Margaret remained
silent, apparently reading.  Presently she
glanced up at the time, laid her book down,
and, rising quietly, went and stood by her
pupil.  Unshed tears glimmered in her eyes
as she looked down upon the child whose
uncontrolled temper meant such misery to
herself.
</p>

<p>
"Girlie," she said softly, "it is almost
eleven, but before you go, I want to ask
you to forgive me for being, as you think,
unkind and nasty.  Listen, Ellice.  When
your mother engaged me to come here as
your governess, she offered me a salary in
exchange for giving so many hours a day
to teaching you.  I agreed to her wishes,
and I should not be honourable if I took her
money and did not fulfil my promise to do
the very best I could for you&mdash;can you
understand that?"
</p>

<p>
"But I don't want to be taught," muttered
the child; "I can teach myself when I am
older."
</p>

<p>
"If you were allowed to do as you wish,
you would find presently, when you were
growing up, you would be despised by all the
other girls of education, because of your
ignorance; you would be behind them probably
in everything.  I don't think you would
like that.  From what I have seen of you, I
believe you would want to be first rather
than last.  Isn't that so?"
</p>

<p>
A half-murmured assent greeted this last.
</p>

<p>
"Can't you see, child, I want to help you?
But you must be willing, and try too if we are
to succeed.  How proud your dear father
will be if his daughter grows up bright and
intelligent, and is able to be a companion to
him some day!  He cares ever so much about
that; he has told me so."
</p>

<p>
A slight movement indicated Ellice was
listening.
</p>

<p>
"There is something else he cares about;
he wants you to grow up sweet and gentle,
and to get over these selfish ways&mdash;do you
know, trying to please and help others
always makes people happier than trying to
please themselves.  You do it, and see.  It
just makes people love you.  Then there is
one other thing I want to say; you are very
fond of flowers.  I know you look at the garden
when you go out, and bury your face in the
sweetness of the lavender bed, and smell the
fragrance of the roses.  Just think how God
loved you when He made the flowers so sweet
to please you&mdash;and gave you your garden
and the woods and everything nice you love
best.  You remember the hymn you sing
sometimes:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'All things bright and beautiful,<br>
  The great God made them all.'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"<i>All</i> things&mdash;and for you&mdash;and in His word
to us He sends you this message&mdash;this
morning: '<i>Study to show yourself a workman
approved of God.</i>'  He has done so much for
us, dear&mdash;He has given us every good thing
we possess.  He came to this earth to die for
us&mdash;to win our love and our allegiance, and
He asks us to show our gratitude by making
a life-study of how to prove our love to Him,
as good workmen.  He wants our best.
Ellice, shall we both make up our minds to
try to give Him that always, to fight against
our tempers, our selfishness; to do even the
dry lessons as well as we can, to please Him?
I have to try too&mdash;all the grown-up people
who love Him have to fight this battle with
self.  It is difficult sometimes, and we often
fail, but God has promised to give us His
Holy Spirit, to enable us to be brave and
strong to do good, if we ask Him."
</p>

<p>
Margaret paused a moment as she gently
stroked the child's bowed head with her hand.
Then:
</p>

<p>
"Ask Him now, darling, to help you all
your life to be a workman approved of God."
</p>

<p>
Again there was silence.  The old clock
ticked those precious moments away, but at
the same time registered a child's desire for a
nobler life.
</p>

<p>
The lesson-time was over as the hour struck.
Lesson books had not, after all, played a
great part in the morning's work; but was
not something learned of greater worth?
</p>

<p>
"Off you go," said Margaret brightly, and,
pressing a light kiss upon the tumbled curls,
she turned and went out quietly, leaving her
charge to her own devices.
</p>

<p>
When they afterwards met at luncheon,
all traces of the storm were past, and Ellice
chatted responsively to the governess she had
intended earlier to hate for ever and ever.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
OLD FRIENDS
</h3>

<p>
Nothing was allowed to disturb Dr. Crane
during his breakfast-time; his
wife took her meal in silence, while he studied
his letters and newspaper.  This morning
was no exception to the general rule, but
suddenly he laid down his correspondence,
and said abruptly:
</p>

<p>
"By the way, Mary, have you heard
anything from Margaret Woodford lately?"
</p>

<p>
"A few days ago," she answered.  "Why
do you ask?"
</p>

<p>
"To tell you the truth, I've never felt
quite satisfied about her going to that post she
accepted.  I really owed it to her father to
find out what kind of people her employers
were."
</p>

<p>
"Well, dear, she didn't give you much
chance of doing that.  You remember she
answered the advertisement, and got the
situation through an agency, and we knew
nothing about it until everything was settled."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but I still feel I ought to have made
a point of inquiring personally.  Does she
seem happy?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know about happy&mdash;I should
imagine not very; one can hardly expect
that, perhaps&mdash;but she mentions the people
are kind, and the country lovely.  It is evident
she is leading a quiet life; her employers for
some reason seem to wish to live in retirement."
</p>

<p>
"Now, I wonder why?  I don't quite like
that fact," said the Doctor, a little testily.
</p>

<p>
"Why, John, surely you are unreasonably
suspicious; the child is evidently in a
comfortable home, and I think must be interested
in her work, or she would not have stayed so
long.  I made her promise to come away to us
at once if she found anything wrong&mdash;in fact
I asked her here for the holidays in August."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm glad you did that!" he interposed
in more satisfied tones.  "And what
does she say?"
</p>

<p>
"I think she fears it would be painful
to see the old home again so soon; she says
she has been asked to stay where she is, and
she would rather remain, and in fact she does
not need rest yet."
</p>

<p>
"I hope it is all right then," answered
Dr. Crane.  "Ask her in your next to tell you
everything unreservedly about the people,
and if she is quite content?  Seems strange
Woodford's daughter should be out in the
world like this, doesn't it?" he finished
musingly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;and how different it might have
been if Jack&mdash;had&mdash;lived," said Mrs. Crane
sadly.
</p>

<p>
"Our hopes were certainly shattered in
more ways than one," he assented, with a
sigh; "but, old lady, we wouldn't have it
otherwise, would we?  God called him for
the service of his country, and when a man
answers that call in His Name, all must be
well.  You miss the boy, I know&mdash;and well&mdash;so
do I, more than I can say; but we are
getting on, and it will be a grand
homecoming when he stands, as we know he will
stand, with outstretched hands to welcome
us on the other side.  I expect we shall be
glad then he went over there first; what do
you say, old dear?" he finished gently, and
coming round to where Mrs. Crane sat, the
tears slowly coursing down her cheeks, he
stooped and kissed her forehead.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, John," she answered.  "I
forget sometimes the joy that is coming, the
waiting seems so long, and yet it's a lovely
thought, the King may come into the air
any day bringing our darling with Him.  There
is nothing necessary to be fulfilled before that
event, is there?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I think not; scripture gives us nothing,
but we must wait patiently, and be content
with God's time and choice."
</p>

<p>
"I love those lines, John:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'At midnight, eve, or morning,<br>
  We may hear the victory song.<br>
  Filling the heavens above us,<br>
  From Redemption's white-robed throng.'"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I wish there were more stricken hearts
comforted with the Thessalonian promises,"
he answered thoughtfully.  "I am amazed at
the numbers of people I come across in my
profession who are apparently content to live
their life as if it were the fulfilment of all
hopes and ambitions, and not merely a
pilgrimage here, an incident in eternity; but
there, I must be off to the surgery," he
concluded, suddenly changing the subject as the
clock struck nine.  As he was closing the
door, he called out hurriedly:
</p>

<p>
"My old friend Hatherley is coming down
here in August to spend his holiday with us."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I <i>am</i> glad!" murmured Mrs. Crane
to herself; "John will enjoy that."
</p>

<p>
Then gathering up her correspondence, she
went to interview cook.  A thought was in
her mind to write Margaret a long motherly
letter of sympathy, giving her all the home
news of interest she could think of, and
especially the Doctor's message.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
BOB IN TROUBLE
</h3>

<p>
Weeks drifted into months, and Margaret,
much to the satisfaction of the inmates
of Oaklands, was still at her post.  Mrs. Crane
had written and invited her to spend
the summer holiday with her in August, but
the thought of seeing the Abbey House again
seemed more than she could bear just then,
and so her old friend's invitation had been
refused, and Margaret stayed on in the new
environment, each day becoming more
necessary in the home of her employers.  Another
letter had arrived from Mrs. Crane this
morning, which yet remained to be answered when
she felt there was more news to write about.
</p>

<p>
The one big fight to gain ascendancy over
her pupil had been worth while.  It is true
Ellice did not give up her opposition without
some further struggle, but her wilfulness never
again carried her so far.  Lesson-time became
more pleasant both to governess and pupil,
and gradually all thought of direct disobedience
passed, sulky silence presently giving
way to an interested co-operation.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Medhurst was not unobservant as to
the friendship springing up between Margaret
and his small daughter, and was well pleased
with the way things were going.  His wife
spent most of her time in her own room,
although she was not a confirmed invalid.
She did not give herself much chance of
knowing or understanding her children's
characters, but she could not help noticing
a subtle change in Ellice.
</p>

<p>
Summer days were quickly passing away,
the plentiful green brambles which grew so
luxuriantly on the common had ripened into
a rich berry harvest; the dainty gossamer
houses of the spiders glistened on the hedgerows,
the tiny ropes of which caught Margaret
Woodford's face as she walked quickly across
the spongy turf to the woods.  She brushed
the irritating threads aside, an anxious
expression clouding the usual brightness of her
countenance.
</p>

<p>
She had come away from the house this
morning perturbed in spirit, and more worried
than she liked to admit to herself.  She had
not waited to find her pupil, but was wanting
to be alone and have time to think quietly.
That something serious had happened was
easy to see from the trouble discernible in her
face.  She had had a wakeful night, and a
not too pleasant interview with Mrs. Medhurst
this morning.
</p>

<p>
The evening before she had gone up to
bed early and sat reading for some time in
the quiet retreat of her room&mdash;Mr. Medhurst
had not returned from town, Mrs. Medhurst
had dinner upstairs, and Ellice was in bed.
It was Wednesday, and Bob would not be
home until the week-end, the September
term having just begun.
</p>

<p>
Upon putting down her book, Margaret
had gone to the dressing-table and opened
her small jewel-box to put away the brooch
she was wearing.  For a few moments she had
stood still, gazing helplessly at the case
before her, astonishment depicted upon her
countenance, her expression gradually changing
to consternation, as she grasped the
unpleasant fact that her beautiful ruby
necklace&mdash;her mother's chain of rare jewels&mdash;the
heirloom which had descended to her&mdash;was
missing.
</p>

<p>
Then, with fingers that trembled a little,
she had turned the box upside down and
shaken out her other jewellery upon the table,
although it was obvious the chain was not
there.  She remembered having taken it
out the previous day, and carelessly left it
lying on the dressing-table.  Hastily she
opened the chest of drawers and swept the
contents aside, hoping to find it had been
placed in safe custody by Betsy.  Then she
had stood up, looking down upon the disorder
she had created among her possessions, her
breath coming a little gaspingly as she
murmured to herself:
</p>

<p>
"It is gone&mdash;<i>stolen</i>&mdash;&mdash;"  And a thought,
so ugly, so disconcerting, had rushed
unbidden to her mind, making her heart beat
unpleasantly at the mere suggestion which
came as a flash of illumination, to be followed
by a cloud of doubt, which enveloped her
mind and filled her with untold misery.
</p>

<p>
She had come to this house a stranger,
she had been kindly treated, and had grown
fond of the young people who had entered
into her life.  The household had appeared
a strange one, and things had puzzled her.
Now something of bitterness sounded in her
voice as she spoke her thoughts aloud.
</p>

<p>
"I trusted them&mdash;I trusted them <i>all</i>," and
now&mdash;the fact could not be doubted, it had
to be faced, and faced bravely, she had been
robbed, it seemed, by someone in this house
who must be a thief.  And yet&mdash;Could
she think it of any of them?  The very
suspicion sent the hot blood surging to her
face&mdash;she had felt shamed by the idea of doubting
her friends&mdash;for they had now become that
to her.  Even Betsy, the old and valued
servant, had lately been ready to do anything
for her, and James, too, did many little things
which added to her comfort.
</p>

<p>
She was miserable and upset when she lay
down to rest; she did not suspect anyone
particularly, and yet the horrid fact that the
jewels were gone could not be got over.
</p>

<p>
Margaret awoke the following morning
with a headache; much of the night had been
spent in restless, wakeful tossing.  Not until
the sun was shedding its soft beams through
her lattice window did she fall into a troubled
sleep.
</p>

<p>
Immediately after breakfast she asked to
see Mrs. Medhurst, and poured out the story
of her loss into sympathetic ears.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Miss Woodford, no wonder you
are upset," she said.  "Your beautiful
necklace you showed me one day&mdash;you
remember&mdash;gone?  I can scarcely believe it.  I can
assure you there are no thieves in this house&mdash;at
least I have every reason to believe Betsy
and James to be above suspicion, they have
been so many years in our service, and we
have so trusted them&mdash;but of course one can
never say one is <i>perfectly</i> sure.  I suppose
you have searched everywhere?  Could it
have fallen behind the dressing-chest?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I have looked; I don't think I have
left a corner unsearched," answered Margaret.
"I have not mentioned the matter to Betsy;
I thought it better to speak to you first; I
should not like to offend or hurt her, or
James, by letting them imagine for a moment
I suspected them."
</p>

<p>
"Quite right, my dear; I think the bare
questioning would upset them; and my
husband will be deeply concerned; I almost
think I would say nothing about it to him just
at present, he is not very well, and I am
certain it would worry him.  I quite expect
you will find it somewhere.  The children
would not steal.  Ellice might have looked
at it, but beyond that&mdash;&mdash;" and Mrs. Medhurst
shrugged her shoulders expressively,
denoting the impossibility of her child being
implicated in the loss.  "My little girl is
troublesome, Miss Woodford, I admit it,
but&mdash;not a thief," she added coldly, with a quick
glance at Margaret's face, and a note of
almost challenge in her voice.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no&mdash;no, Mrs. Medhurst, I do not think
little Ellice has had anything to do with it,"
answered Margaret.  "She has come into
my room sometimes with me, and looked at
my things, but I am quite sure she would
not dream of taking anything&mdash;please do not
suppose I imagine it for a moment?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, well, let us leave the matter for a
little, and both of us keep our eyes open; at
present I can see no explanation, but I have
no doubt you <i>will</i> find your necklace.  I
should not mention the matter to the child,
but have another good search.  Ellice can be
very troublesome, and she may have hidden
it; if so, she must be punished."
</p>

<p>
Margaret could get no further definite help
or suggestion from Mrs. Medhurst&mdash;in fact the
above conversation had given her an uneasy
sense of discomfort; it seemed as if her hostess,
although she had sympathised, almost doubted
her loss, and considered her personal
carelessness was alone responsible.
</p>

<p>
This morning, as she made her way across
the fields, she felt homesick, and almost wished
she had never accepted her present post.
Mrs. Crane had written more than once to
ask if she was happy, and if everything was
satisfactory in connection with this household.
In fact, now she thought things over,
it appeared as if some possibility of her
environment not being satisfactory lurked in the
minds of her old friends.  In her last letter
Mrs. Crane had said, "<i>Be sure, my dear child,
to tell me exactly all your views, and just what
this situation means?  Are the Medhursts the
right kind of people?  Your previous communications
are rather vague; give us your full
confidence&mdash;you know how dear you are to us.
The Doctor wants especially to hear if you are
quite content in every way with your surroundings;
if not, be sure and come away to us
at once.</i>"
</p>

<p>
Margaret had smiled when she had first
read the above.  Mrs. Crane's evident anxiety
about her had seemed quite unnecessary at
the moment; but now, in the light of her
loss, she wondered if her old friends could
possibly have heard anything disquieting
about Oaklands.
</p>

<p>
"I won't answer that letter just yet,"
she murmured to herself.  "What <i>would</i> they
think if they knew?  But oh, how I wish I
could ask their advice!"  She walked on
unheeding the glory of the trees flushed with
harlequin tints, and the rare sweetness of the
fresh, hill-cooled breeze which swept over the
common, dying into stillness and warmth as
she entered the shelter of the woods.  She
presently sat down by the old oak, and, opening
the book she had brought with her, tried
to lose herself in the troubles of the heroine
of <i>Stepping Heavenwards</i>, where the daily
round and common task is so naturally
described by an author who realised how truly
these things furnish all we need to provide
a battleground for those of us fighting the
fight of faith, on our way towards home.
</p>

<p>
A rustle in the brushwood near presently
roused Margaret's attention, and to her utter
surprise Bob's face peered through the wooded
density, and in another moment he had pushed
his way into the open and flung himself at
Margaret's feet.
</p>

<p>
"<i>You</i>, Bob!" she exclaimed, in amazement.
"Why&mdash;where do you come from?
This is only Friday&mdash;you are not due until
to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
There was no answer.  The boy had thrown
himself face downward upon the mossy turf,
and buried his face in his hands.
</p>

<p>
Margaret waited for a little, then, realising
this meant something of moment to the boy,
said gently:
</p>

<p>
"Bob, what <i>is</i> it?  What has happened?
Won't you tell me?"
</p>

<p>
A sound like a smothered groan fell from
the boy's lips, then, bending her head, she
caught the words:
</p>

<p>
"Miss Woodford&mdash;I'm&mdash;I'm in trouble."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I guessed so.  Can't I help you?"
she added, the rare sympathy of her voice
reaching his ear.
</p>

<p>
The boy rolled over, and sat up, and something
she saw in his face filled her with a
nameless anxiety.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me all about it.  I&mdash;-I shall
understand," she said kindly.  "However bad it
is, don't be afraid."
</p>

<p>
Her tones and manner seemed to give the
boy confidence.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Woodford, I'm often in trouble,
as you know," he said, a little bitterly.  "I
can stand a licking all right, but&mdash;but my
father never seems to think&mdash;to think I try.
He never believes in me; he's told me I'm
a rotter so&mdash;often.  He's fond of Ellice&mdash;but
sometimes I think he <i>hates</i> me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no&mdash;no, don't say or think that for
a moment," broke in Margaret, a great pity
tugging at her heart.  "He doesn't quite
understand, that is all.  You must go on
trying, Bob, however hard it is.  You will
win his regard yet&mdash;I am sure&mdash;sure."
</p>

<p>
There was a pause, and then the boy
continued, almost as if she had not spoken:
</p>

<p>
"He will never forgive me for this.  He
won't listen to explanations.  I got in a rage
about something this morning&mdash;I can't tell
you what for&mdash;a boy said something, and I
knocked him down.  I had a cricket stump in
my hand&mdash;and&mdash;I hurled it at him.  I think
for the moment I was mad with indignation;
I don't quite know what happened for a
minute.  I think I was <i>blind</i> with rage.  I
just rushed away afterwards to the edge of
the field to get alone.  Later a prefect came
and told me the Headmaster wanted me.
He gave me this note to deliver to my father,
and sent me home with it.  He said&mdash;I'd
hurt&mdash;the boy&mdash;he'd been unconscious.  He
asked me to explain what I did it for&mdash;but&mdash;I
couldn't."
</p>

<p>
"What a pity," said Margaret; "it might
have made a difference."
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;I think he would have understood;
he's just&mdash;but I felt I couldn't.  I would not
repeat the boy's words&mdash;I should have got
mad again."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Bob, I am sorry, dear!  Now what
can you do?  You have a note there, you say.
Your father comes home early to-day; let's
go at once and tell him&mdash;tell him everything
and get it over; perhaps he will understand."
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;he won't, because I can't tell him;
if I could, he would, because my father is a
gentleman."
</p>

<p>
Something that sounded like pride echoed
in the boy's voice&mdash;pride of the right
sort&mdash;pride that spoke of a secret admiration for
the man who yet had never troubled to
fathom the depths of his boy's heart.
</p>

<p>
Margaret felt a hope for better things
spring up within her as she noted it.  Oh, if
only she could bring these two together in a
great bond of friendship!  The wife and
mother seemed a little more aloof, her half
Spanish nationality a little bridge always to be
crossed, where national character and custom
might be at variance.  But the boy and the
man were essentially English; the strong
control evident in both, with a reserve which
hid, as she felt sure, hearts of gold.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Bob dear, let's go&mdash;it is nearly
lunch-time."
</p>

<p>
"Miss Woodford, I would rather&mdash;rather
run away than face my father with this."  The
boy spoke a little desperately, and the
fingers which held the Headmaster's note
trembled as he thrust it back into his pocket.
</p>

<p>
"Bob, I know you are no coward," said
Margaret gently; "to run from a difficult
post is coward's work.  You won't do it, I
know.  You are trying to be a servant of
Christ; isn't that so?"
</p>

<p>
"I was," he muttered, "but it seems no use."
</p>

<p>
"Think a moment of what the Captain of
your salvation did for you&mdash;when the suffering
of Calvary had to be endured, and the agony
of the cross lay before Him.  It says, speaking
of Him, He set His face like a flint.  He
could have escaped that last journey to
Jerusalem, have gone back to the glory of
His Heavenly Father's home, but for your
sake He chose to suffer and to die.  Bob,
His message to you at this moment seems to
me to be some words I read in His Book
this morning: 'Endure hardness as a good
soldier of Jesus Christ.'  The Holy Spirit,
Who filled the heart and life of the Saviour,
can come upon you, and make you brave and
strong.  Ask Him now."
</p>

<p>
Pressing the boy's hand, Margaret moved
a little away, and as she gazed upwards to
the blue sky gleaming through the branches
overhead, she lifted up a silent petition to
the great Friend of all mankind.  Her own
burden lightened as she laid that of another
pilgrim at the feet of Christ.
</p>

<p>
Her thoughts were disturbed by Bob's
voice in her ears:
</p>

<p>
"Let's go now, Miss Woodford, and get it over."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's late," she answered, neither
looking at the boy's face, nor appearing
conscious of an apparent change of atmosphere
from the excitement of distress to normality.
But the quiet, even tones of the boy's voice
gave her confidence.
</p>

<p>
It did not take long to reach home; lunch
was just being laid.  James paused in astonishment
as he saw the two enter the hall, but a
look from Margaret silenced the words on
his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Where is Mr. Medhurst?" she asked, in
a brisk voice.
</p>

<p>
"In the library, miss," answered James,
and moved on to his duties in the dining-room.
</p>

<p>
"Come, let's find him," she said, turning
to Bob.
</p>

<p>
"You need not come," he muttered.
</p>

<p>
"I would like to, if I may?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
No more was said, and the two entered
the room together.
</p>

<p>
"Bob wants to speak to you, Mr. Medhurst,"
she said, by way of explanation, and then
moved to the window, leaving the boy facing
his father.  She caught the quick look of
surprise deepening into a swift survey of the
boy's form as if to ascertain if there had been
an accident and he was unhurt.  Margaret
realised the unspoken anxiety, although it
was but momentary.  The man was evidently
not indifferent to his son's welfare.  That
cursory glance gave her hope, but even
she was scarcely prepared for the sudden
change of aspect which now swept over
him, his countenance visibly darkening as
he said:
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?" and the icy
coldness was enough to estrange any young
heart anxious to unburden itself.
</p>

<p>
A shiver ran down the boy's back as he
heard it, for a moment his courage failed, and
he stood staring at the stern face in front of
him, his own white with the tensity of the
moment.  Then he pulled himself together,
"Endure hardness as a good soldier"&mdash;the
words rushed to his brain.  He raised his
head a little more as if to cast away fear with
disdain, then, taking out of his pocket the
Headmaster's note, he handed it to his
father.
</p>

<p>
"Dr. Armstrong sent me home&mdash;and told
me to give you that," he said, in a low but
clear voice.
</p>

<p>
Something of a sneer lurked on his father's
lips as he took it, then, as he read the contents,
his brow contracted with a heavy frown.
Fear, deadly fear, came to Margaret as she
heard his voice, of, it seemed, concentrated
wrath as, with a wave of his hand, he said:
</p>

<p>
"Get out of the room&mdash;go upstairs!  I'll
come to you."
</p>

<p>
The boy turned white and hopeless, but
Margaret, with real terror in her heart,
sprang forward:
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Medhurst, please&mdash;<i>please</i> excuse me
speaking in Bob's behalf, but I am sure, if
you knew all the circumstances in this trouble,
you would find it in your heart to forgive
him," she pleaded.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Medhurst was too much of a gentleman
not to be courteous to a woman, though
he could scarcely brook interference.
</p>

<p>
"You are the counsel for the defence, I
perceive, Miss Woodford, but I'm afraid you
have no case; perhaps you don't understand
my son&mdash;<i>my</i> son in blind passion has struck
a schoolfellow with a cricket stump and
injured him, apparently without provocation,
as far as the Headmaster has been able to
ascertain."
</p>

<p>
"And do you believe that, Mr. Medhurst&mdash;believe
it of <i>your</i> son?  You don't know
Bob fully yet.  Your son could never behave
like that; to him, a schoolboy, it would not
be cricket, would it?"
</p>

<p>
"That's the gist of the matter, perhaps,"
he answered; "he is my son, and I expect
a decent spirit from him."
</p>

<p>
"Then let him explain the circumstances,
Mr. Medhurst; don't punish him until you
have heard <i>everything</i>&mdash;it is only justice."
</p>

<p>
"Quite true.  Can you deny these facts?"
asked Mr. Medhurst, tapping the Headmaster's
statement, and now addressing Bob,
who, at Margaret's intervention, had paused
near the door.
</p>

<p>
"It's true&mdash;but&mdash;but I was provoked, sir."
</p>

<p>
"So I suppose; but to what extent?"
</p>

<p>
"I would rather not say," answered the boy.
</p>

<p>
"There you are, Miss Woodford, I
have followed your advice," said
Mr. Medhurst, with a short sarcastic laugh.
"You see, the boy has no excuse worthy of
consideration; he's ashamed to bring it
forward."
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;I am&mdash;that's true," broke in Bob.
"Don't bother, Miss Woodford; I know I
can't escape."
</p>

<p>
"Bob, you can&mdash;you must," Margaret
insisted.  "Whatever it is, tell your father;
trust him, trust him with the full story, and
he will understand&mdash;I know he will," she said
eagerly.
</p>

<p>
Even Gordon Medhurst was moved by the
girl's confidence.  Was it possible she was
right, and this son of his was not the wastrel
he feared and believed?
</p>

<p>
There was tense silence for a moment, then
the boy spoke again:
</p>

<p>
"I struck the boy Johnson in a passion
because&mdash;because he said, I ought to be
turned out of the eleven because&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;because?" encouraged Margaret.
</p>

<p>
"Because my father was a&mdash;a <i>gaol bird</i>;
then&mdash;I hit him&mdash;I hit him hard&mdash;and I
didn't care how hard."
</p>

<p>
There was a breathless pause which could
almost be felt.  Margaret was afraid the
others would hear the loud thumping of her
heart as the long moments passed.  Then in
a voice from which it sounded as if all feeling
had passed, Mr. Medhurst said quietly:
</p>

<p>
"What put such an idea in the boy's head,
I wonder?"
</p>

<p>
"He said he heard his father tell a chum,"
answered Bob.
</p>

<p>
"What is the boy's name, by the way?"
</p>

<p>
"Johnson&mdash;his father is a barrister."
</p>

<p>
Did Margaret hear a catch in his breath as
Mr. Medhurst said: "Ah, Johnson."
</p>

<p>
Again there was silence, and then:
</p>

<p>
"Did you believe the boy's statement?"
asked Mr. Medhurst, still in that dull, toneless
voice of indifference.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Believe him</i>, father!"  The light of
indignant scorn flamed into the boy's eyes
and rang in his voice: "Believe him, believe
that of <i>my</i> father!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Medhurst suddenly leaned forward, a
new expression in his face, an interested
alertness in his voice.
</p>

<p>
"I see&mdash;you trust me&mdash;eh?  Then why
such excitement over the boy's remark?"
</p>

<p>
"I punished his insolence, sir.  How dared
he say such a thing!"
</p>

<p>
"You knocked him out, evidently.  I don't
suppose he'll offend again, though I fancy his
father may object.  This may mean a doctor's
bill, but never mind that, I expect there is no
serious damage.  You had better stay at home
until Monday, and meanwhile I will write to
Dr. Armstrong.  And another time, keep
your temper, my son, and treat such remarks
with the cold contempt they deserve.  I
think we must be better friends in the future,
eh?" he added.  The kindly smile which
lit his face as he spoke these last words
transfigured it; tears glistened in the
boy's eyes.
</p>

<p>
Margaret left the room hurriedly, a great
hope and joy tugging at her heart; for the
first time since she came to Oaklands she had
seen an expression of affection pass between
father and son.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
DISCOVERY
</h3>

<p>
It was a month now since Margaret's
necklace had disappeared, and she had
almost given up hope of its recovery.
Mrs. Medhurst still advised her to continue the
search, but to refrain from troubling
Mr. Medhurst, as he had so many business worries,
and would, she felt sure, be upset by the loss.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, it is wiser to keep the matter
from the children; they can know nothing
about it.  I have always trusted Betsy and
James, they are such old servants, and nothing
of the kind has ever happened before.  I have
questioned them, dear Miss Woodford.  We
must both watch and wait; still, somehow I
feel sure you will recover the jewels.  I still
think you must have mislaid them.  I feel so
worried about your loss, I believe I could find
it."  So she had argued.
</p>

<p>
Margaret smiled at the suggestion of her
having put the necklace away and overlooked
it.  She had searched her boxes more than
once, and turned out all her drawers, and now,
anxious to soothe Mrs. Medhurst's anxiety,
she promised to go over them all again.
</p>

<p>
It was Monday evening, Ellice was in bed,
and Mr. Medhurst had not yet returned from
a day in town, and Margaret (deciding it
would be very comfortable to take a book
and read in her own domain) went upstairs
determined to have an extra rest.  She
passed Mrs. Medhurst's room on her way,
and as she did so a slight sound attracted her
attention.
</p>

<p>
To her amazement she saw the flash of an
electric light, and then caught sight of a
figure bending over the dressing-table and
evidently gazing intently at something she
held in her left hand, while with the right she
concentrated the beam from her torch upon
the object of interest.
</p>

<p>
Margaret stood silently watching for a few
moments, petrified with astonishment as she
perceived what it was the light was
concentrated upon.
</p>

<p>
There was no mistaking her employer's
beautiful figure.  The door was wide open,
and the girl was unnoticed by the occupant
of the room, who was apparently so absorbed
she did not notice the light tread as Margaret
suddenly advanced to her side.  The room
was partly drowned in shadow, but a bright
beam of moonlight lit up the two, the one so
unconscious of the other's presence.  Then a
sharp cry burst involuntarily from Margaret's
lips as she darted forward and caught
Mrs. Medhurst's wrist in a firm grasp.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;you!" she exclaimed, almost a
ring of anguish in the indignant tones of her
voice.
</p>

<p>
A startled exclamation broke from her
employer, as the lost necklace fell from her
nerveless fingers.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;you the <i>thief</i>, Mrs. Medhurst?  Oh,
I could never have dreamed it possible!"
said Margaret agitatedly.  "You&mdash;who
pretended such sympathy, and help!  No wonder
you said you believed you could find
it."  The last words were bitter in their
reproach.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Medhurst had somewhat recovered
herself, although she clasped and unclasped
her hands nervously.  Then she stepped back
a pace and drew herself up to her full height,
and, forcing indignation into her voice,
answered haughtily:
</p>

<p>
"I think you must be mad!  How dare you
accuse me of such things!  I will send you out
of my house at a moment's notice if you
repeat here, or to anyone else, your absurd
accusations."
</p>

<p>
Margaret was almost stunned by the
answer; she felt herself falling into an
awkward position, although the certainty still
dwelt in her mind that in this superbly elegant
woman before her she had discovered the
thief she had been looking for.
</p>

<p>
"If you did not take the necklace,
Mrs. Medhurst, can you tell me how it comes
to be in your possession?" she asked
quietly.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile another figure had come
softly up the stairs, and now stood in the
doorway, a silent listener to the conversation.
</p>

<p>
"I can easily answer that question,"
answered Mrs. Medhurst, with a short,
contemptuous laugh.  "I went out into the
garden a few moments ago to get a little
cool air, it has been so stifling to-day,
and as I walked down the drive I saw
something which looked bright in the
moonlight.  I picked it up, and discovered it
was your lost property.  I meant to give
it you in the morning; you had better
take it now."  With this she stooped and
gathered the gemmed chain into her hands,
and held it out to Margaret with a little cold
smile.
</p>

<p>
Margaret took it with shaking fingers, the
ready words of gratitude which would ordinarily
have sprung from her heart at its restoration
seemed frozen upon her lips.  There
was a moment's tense silence when each
looked into the eyes of the other, and then,
almost unconsciously, the glances of both,
as if by intuition, turned towards the
door.
</p>

<p>
There stood the master of the house, his
face drawn and white, an expression of silent
misery on his countenance, as he looked
steadily at his wife.  A start&mdash;and a smothered
groan escaped her.
</p>

<p>
"Gordon&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;have&mdash;heard?" she
whispered, in low, broken tones.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;I have heard, and understood,
Lucille," he answered slowly.
</p>

<p>
In a flash the woman's whole demeanour
changed; with a cry almost like that of a
tortured animal, she sank down at Margaret's
feet.
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;I've broken&mdash;my promise.  I couldn't
help it&mdash;&mdash;  I&mdash;I&mdash;-was so tempted," she
moaned.  "It was&mdash;so&mdash;lovely&mdash;I just wanted
to have it&mdash;to look at sometimes&mdash;&mdash;  Gordon&mdash;Gordon,
forgive me!&mdash;it shall&mdash;be the last
time&mdash;I promise&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Get up," he answered sternly, giving her
his hand&mdash;and, helping her to rise, he led her
to a couch, where she buried her head in the
cushions, smothering the sobs which shook
her frame.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Woodford, you now know the
tragedy of our lives," he said bitterly.  "We
place ourselves in your hands; we have no right
to ask your mercy.  Perhaps you
would&mdash;like&mdash;to&mdash;send for the police," he added slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Send for&mdash;the police?  What for?" gasped Margaret.
</p>

<p>
"To arrest me," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;why&mdash;<i>you</i>?  It has nothing to do
with you, Mr. Medhurst!" she replied, in
amazement.
</p>

<p>
"I shall give myself up, and admit the
theft to whoever may offer an arrest," he
answered.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Medhurst&mdash;I cannot understand,"
answered Margaret.
</p>

<p>
"No, Miss Woodford&mdash;of course you cannot.
I will explain: My wife has made a
similar <i>mistake</i> before, and I have served
some months in a world behind the scenes.
You must understand," he continued, almost
fiercely, "I am ready to serve again."  Then,
turning towards Mrs. Medhurst, he said,
"Hush&mdash;hush, Lucille; you will be ill if
you excite yourself so."
</p>

<p>
All his sternness had vanished, lost in an
infinite pity as he bent over his wife's
couch.
</p>

<p>
She clutched his hand hysterically.
</p>

<p>
"Gordon&mdash;you shan't suffer again.  Tell
her to go and give information&mdash;I will be here,
and I will admit I took it.  Tell her to
go&mdash;go quickly&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
And again the woman's head sank into the
downy hiding-place.
</p>

<p>
Slowly great tears welled up into Margaret
Woodford's eyes, as she saw and heard the
true nature of the secret of Oaklands, and
understood.
</p>

<p>
The quiet man stood out in heroic light,
and yet to him how small a matter the punishment
inflicted by the law to the daily dread&mdash;the
covering of the old fault&mdash;and the daily,
hourly strain to prevent a further fall.  Yet
here it was in all its hideousness, displayed
to Margaret Woodford&mdash;the one outside
element who had been received into a stricken
house.
</p>

<p>
For a moment emotion held her silent, and
then, with quick steps, she moved across the
room, and sank down by Mrs. Medhurst's
couch.
</p>

<p>
"Don't&mdash;don't cry&mdash;you poor&mdash;poor
woman!  You have restored my property,"
she said gently&mdash;the tears rolling unbidden
down her sweet face.  "Dear Mrs. Medhurst,
<i>how</i> you must have suffered&mdash;and to think
you thought I would ever say anything.  Oh,
I can't bear to dwell upon it!  You must
let me help you in your trouble&mdash;and the
necklace?  Of course you liked to look at
it&mdash;everyone does&mdash;and you may take it
whenever you like, and keep it all your
life, if you wish&mdash;I shall never ask for
it&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You would do that for <i>me</i>&mdash;a thief?"
gasped Mrs. Medhurst, starting up from her
pillows, and gazing with amazement at the
girl before her.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes&mdash;indeed I would&mdash;I offer it
freely: don't doubt me.  You have all been
sweet and good to me&mdash;do you think I forget?
If there is a secret to be kept at Oaklands,
remember I am a member of this household
now&mdash;you welcomed me into your home&mdash;and
the mystery can remain always unsolved
by the outside world, so far as I am
concerned."
</p>

<p>
There was silence in the room for a
few minutes; Margaret still knelt by
Mrs. Medhurst's couch, gently chafing her
hands, while the other cried quietly with
an abandonment of grief difficult to overcome.
</p>

<p>
Presently Margaret rose and gently
released the cold hands she held, and turned
to leave the room.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Medhurst's voice arrested her footsteps.
As she reached the door, he took one stride
towards her, and held out his hand: "We
can never, never thank you sufficiently for
your generous attitude of mind, Miss Woodford.
I don't understand why you spare us?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Medhurst, the reason is, we are all
answerable to the same Master," she answered
gently, as she accepted his hand.
</p>

<p>
"What master?" he answered, looking puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"One Who gave us this command for all
time and all ages, 'Bear ye one another's
burdens and so fulfil the law of Christ,'" she
replied.
</p>

<p>
"And that is your religion?" he interrogated.
</p>

<p>
"It is an order of the King of kings sent to
me by His servant, and I love to try and
obey it&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"I love Him, Christ, my Lord and my
God," she answered softly.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Medhurst's sobs had ceased now, and
except for the ticking of the clock, there was
silence in the room.  Then:
</p>

<p>
"I wish I could say those words; a
practical faith such as yours must mean the
peace of God which passeth understanding,
of which I have heard, but never experienced,"
Mr. Medhurst said sadly.
</p>

<p>
"Those who seek always find, if they seek
with all their hearts&mdash;and oh, Mr. Medhurst,
in all the big troubles of life, as well as the
small ones, that peace is always a reality to
us when we trust; we only get faithless when
we look down at the difficulties, instead of up
to Him Who never fails.  Good night," she
finished&mdash;a little hurriedly, almost afraid
she had said too much.  Turning swiftly,
she vanished into the darkened passage, and
went to her room.  She was a good deal
shaken by all she had just been through, and
a feeling of exhaustion followed the
excitement.  She understood now the nature of
Mrs. Medhurst's failing, and the loyalty of her
husband who had borne the burden of his
wife's disgrace.  The reason for their life's
seclusion in this quiet little place was fully
explained.  Society, and his old friends, had
broken with the man who had endured
imprisonment, and the wretched woman who
had been pitied, and yet shunned by the
set who once were proud to associate with
her, had willingly left them to drift into
obscurity.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately the children were young in
those first days of trouble, and their father
was most anxious the shadow should not fall
upon them if it could be prevented.  His son
he intended sending abroad when he was
older, and his little daughter might be guarded
for many years in her own home.  Her
education had always been a difficulty, for
her mother's lassitude and spoiling had nearly
wrecked the charm of a naturally generous
and affectionate disposition.  Father and son
had always been antagonistic.  The strain
and sorrow of Mr. Medhurst's life had caused
an irritability at times which had dulled any
sympathy and understanding he might have
felt for Robert.
</p>

<p>
To this strange household Margaret
Woodford believed she had been sent upon
a work of ministry for the King Whom
she acknowledged as the Overlord of her
life.
</p>

<p>
As she sat now in her room, thinking of all
the difficulties of her present situation, an
intense longing to be faithful arose in her
heart.  It was a wonderful thought, that for
service she had been selected to serve just
here&mdash;chosen&mdash;and called&mdash;it was almost as
if the King had said, speaking of this
particular post: "Who will go for us?"
and she had answered, "Here am I, send me."
</p>

<p>
For a moment she sank upon her knees,
and an unspoken prayer arose to the Throne
of God: "Give me wisdom and strength by
the power of Thy Holy Spirit to be <i>faithful</i>."  She
knew the way might yet be difficult,
and there would no doubt be many future
trials to bear, but with a quick transition of
thought the hymn lines, so simple in their
direction to God's people, flashed into her
mind:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Peace, perfect peace, by thronging duties pressed?<br>
  To do the will of Jesus, this is rest."<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and in the calmness engendered by that
thought, she lay down to sleep that night,
content to leave all to the guidance of Him
Who is not only the Everlasting Father&mdash;and
Prince of Peace; but the Mighty God&mdash;and
Counsellor.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
A BOND OF UNION
</h3>

<p>
In spite of weariness, human frailty, and,
sometimes, lack of faith, Margaret's
ministry for the King Whom she loved was a
real one.  She was conscious of unworthiness,
and had a sensitive dread of being considered
one who talked religion, and posed as a
religious person.  She knew only too well that
she herself was among the sinners who have
all fallen short of the glory of God; but she
believed in the greatness of the Saviour's
redeeming power, and His willingness to
accept as His servants all who turn in
repentance to Him.  Frances Ridley Havergal's
lines just expressed her need, and the faith
He asks of all of us:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Jesus, I will trust Thee,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trust without a doubt,<br>
  Whosoever cometh<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wilt not cast out."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
She could never have quite said when she
first believed that.  Gradually the knowledge
of God's love had come to her; from
His own Word rather than from any other
source she had found the truth as it is in Jesus.
He Who had stood before the great Galilean
crowds of men, boys, women, and young girls,
and cried, "Come unto Me all ye that are
weary and are heavy laden," so calling all
the world to find their happiness in Him&mdash;had
called <i>her</i>&mdash;and as a young schoolgirl she
had responded to that call, giving Him back
the answer He asked: "Jesus, I will trust
Thee, help me by Thy Holy Spirit to be Thy
faithful servant."
</p>

<p>
She needed no priest to intervene, but, like
the woman who met the Lord by the well of
Samaria, she found her Saviour alone, and He
spoke through His Word to her heart.  The
natural and only outcome of that meeting
of sinner and Saviour was a desire to henceforth
live to His honour, and again, like the
Samaritan, she felt the desire to tell others
of the God Who had won her love by His own.
</p>

<p>
Someone had asked her once to explain
what was the difference between the
professing Christian and the kind, good-living
man or woman who did not profess faith in
Christ.
</p>

<p>
"To me it is like this," she had answered.
"Before I became His servant, when I did
wrong I did not particularly care unless it
brought trouble to me personally, but after,
when I consciously sinned, I was miserable,
because I felt and knew I had dishonoured
Christ.  As we read of Peter, after his denial
of his Master, he went out and wept bitterly&mdash;that
last word 'bitterly' shows the meaning,
I think; his tears were not for his own
trouble, but they were tears&mdash;bitter tears of
shame and regret that he had failed towards
the One Who had loved and trusted him."
</p>

<p>
Margaret's explanation had silenced the
critic.  The true followers of Christ repent
their failures, while their grief is often hidden
from the eyes of man.  But the Lord lifts up
the fallen and gives strength for the needs of
the battle, not only for to-day, but until the
warfare is over, and then the servant of God
enters into the presence of his King, and in
<i>His righteousness</i> is presented <i>faultless</i> before
His Father's Throne.
</p>

<p>
It is just a wonderful religion&mdash;glorious,
all-satisfying to the inner cravings of every
restless heart&mdash;so Margaret Woodford had
found it, and her little work of gratitude and
returned love just went on day by day, like
the stone which is cast into still waters,
and causes the ripples to extend and overlap
until they come to the edge of the surface,
and touch the land.  Thus the little words,
little actions, done for Christ's sake will pass
on and on until they find their consummation
in eternity, in that country from which comes
the promise, "I will not forget your work
and labour of love which ye have showed for
My Name's sake."
</p>

<p>
And this message of love and mercy
Margaret carried in different ways to all the
inmates of Oaklands, even into the seclusion
of Mrs. Medhurst's life.
</p>

<p>
It was not an easy matter to approach
the latter, but, finding her one day in an
abandonment of grief, Margaret knelt down
by her side, and with real sympathy just
drew her towards the secret of eternal rest.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Medhurst had listened to all she said
and had not been offended, and from that day
onwards it became a little added work to
spend half an hour, or sometimes an hour, in
reading and talking to her employer of the
things she loved.
</p>

<p>
"And you can forgive me?  Forgive what
I did, and come to me like this!" had been
Lucille Medhurst's astonished cry.  "Miss
Woodford, if ever I can believe as you do, it
will be because I see your religion is a <i>reality</i>,"
she had said.
</p>

<p>
"It will be by the power of the Holy Spirit,
Mrs. Medhurst," was Margaret's answer, "for
we cannot come unto God except by Him,
and He draws all who are willing."
</p>

<p>
So the little work of a daily ministry went
on at Oaklands.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
"Miss Woodford, may I show you something?"
said Bob, as he entered the schoolroom
one day at the close of a cold winter's
afternoon and found Margaret and Ellice
busy working, sitting by a lovely log fire which
spluttered and sent out lively sparks as the
flame travelled up the chimney.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I say, it is jolly warm here!"
exclaimed the boy, as he flung himself down by
the hearth.  "I am tired, I can tell you.
It's a big trudge up the hill after the train
gets in."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes&mdash;don't I know?  I remember my
first drive here.  Shall I ever forget it?"
laughed Margaret.  "I wondered whenever I
was coming to the end; it seemed a tremendous
distance in the dark.  But never mind
that, you said you had something to show
us&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, what is it?" broke in Ellice eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"This," answered Bob, drawing from his
pocket a triangle design worked in silks within
which a unicorn ramped, a Latin motto
pressing its feet.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Bob, your colours!  How splendid!
I am glad&mdash;and First Eleven too!  Won't your
father be proud of you?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't mention it to him, please,"
said the boy, colouring.  "He thinks me
such a rotter at work, and he may be
vexed&mdash;and think I waste my time at
games&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
A bright smile lit Margaret's face as she
replied.
</p>

<p>
"You have no eyes, old boy, or you wouldn't
say that.  Didn't you ever notice your father
reading the cricket news in the summer?
Don't make any mistake, I'm nearly sure
he's a sportsman, and don't you doubt for a
moment but he'll appreciate your success.
A boy doesn't get his first 'eleven' colours
without some trouble, perseverance, and grit.
Just show this to Mr. Medhurst, and see if I
am not right?"
</p>

<p>
"Shall I go and tell him about it?" said
Ellice, springing to her feet.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;no, child, it's your brother's news;
let him have that pleasure."
</p>

<p>
At that moment there was a tread of
footsteps outside the room, and then a
knock, followed by the opening of the
door.
</p>

<p>
"May I come in, Miss Woodford?" said
Mr. Medhurst, as he entered.  "You sound
lively in here."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes&mdash;daddy, come&mdash;Bob's got&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" interposed Margaret, shaking
her head at the eager child, who immediately
stopped short in her sentence with, "Oh, I
am not to tell."
</p>

<p>
"Bob's got, what?" asked Mr. Medhurst,
turning to his son, with interested face, from
which the thunder-clouds of old days were
absent.
</p>

<p>
Bob coloured furiously, then rather shyly
drew out his trophy.
</p>

<p>
"Only this, father," he said awkwardly,
placing it in Mr. Medhurst's outstretched
hand.
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;colours!  Yours?  First Eleven?
Well done, Bob!  I <i>am</i> pleased!  I congratulate
you; it's something worth having&mdash;reminds
me, too, of old days," he finished, with a
laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Why, did you play cricket, daddy?"
asked Ellice.
</p>

<p>
"Well, little lady, I suppose I did; was
School Captain one season; if I remember
rightly, just missed my blue at the 'Varsity
by a bit of bad luck."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Father!</i>" exclaimed Bob, his eyes
shining, "do tell us about it?"
</p>

<p>
The two, father and son, in many ways so
much alike, forgot all their old reticence
towards each other, and were soon deep in
the stories of old triumphs of the field,
henceforth bound together by a great sympathetic
bond never to be broken.
</p>

<p>
Margaret sat and listened with a double
interest, watching life-barriers broken down,
barriers which had so nearly wrecked the
happiness of a home.

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br><br>
FIRE
</h3>

<p>
Margaret seemed to have found her
niche in the little parish of Wychcliff,
where she had come as a stranger
in the first days of her great sorrow.
Oaklands had now gradually become a second
home.  The dread secret she shared with
her employers was jealously guarded, but
often in the solitude of her room it would
stare her in the face, and bring a cloud
of depression over an otherwise happy
day.
</p>

<p>
The better understanding between Bob
and his father, which had begun with the
school trouble, had been a great relief to her
mind: the domestic atmosphere of the whole
house had been brighter and more congenial
since that day.  But words spoken then, and
not much heeded at the time, had often
recurred to her mind afterwards, at first with
a sense of shock.
</p>

<p>
Bob's schoolfellow had said he was the son
of a gaol-bird.  This announcement, coming
so quickly after the loss of her necklace, had
presented an ugly possibility, and at first she
had not been able to shake off the misery of
doubt concerning her host, and yet when she
had looked at his face, and studied his
personality, she had been ashamed of the wretched
suspicion which had dared to lift its ugly
head.  In her heart of hearts she had not
really doubted him&mdash;there was something
indefinite in this man which breathed a hidden
nobility of character.  Margaret had felt she
could only hope, and pray that the mystery
might some day be fully explained to the
world.  Mrs. Medhurst had not again alluded
to their confidences in regard to the loss,
and Margaret felt she did not like to bring
the subject up again, for fear of causing
sadness.  Then the unpleasant incident in
connection with Bob, in spite of all her
efforts to forget it, worried her more than
she cared to admit to herself, for although
she understood in a measure the truth
concerning her employer, she felt all was not
quite clear.
</p>

<p>
Ellice's moods were still variable, and at
times the patience of her governess was sorely
tried.  A ramble in the woods and
"tree-stories," as she called them, often drove
the stormy clouds away, and gradually a
real affection sprang up in the child's
heart for the teacher who could be firm and,
in spite of provocation, could keep her
temper.
</p>

<p>
It was a great asset&mdash;that keeping calm.
There was never a scene of violence, for
Margaret did not need the use of hot, angry
words to stem the torrent of passionate
outbursts which even now sometimes fell from
the child's lips.  At such times Ellice was
transformed from a charming, affectionate
little person into a spoilt, unpleasant, and
objectionable child.
</p>

<p>
But if her temper was bad, her repentance
was real; she would just fling herself into
Margaret's arms after a storm, and exclaim,
"Oh, Miss Woodford, I was nasty!&mdash;I hate
myself!  I don't know what makes me so
horrid&mdash;I seem as if I can't be good."  And
just because the battle was great, Margaret's
sympathy went out to her charge, and gently,
gradually she led her to fight daily against
the second self which troubled her, and also
to pray for strength in the battle.
</p>

<p>
Ellice would sometimes begin her tantrums
(they could be called nothing else), and
suddenly remember&mdash;yes, remember&mdash;with a
pang of remorse for her defection, God's own
word, "Better is he that ruleth his spirit,
than he that taketh a city."  In an instant
she would rush away to the window, and,
clenching her hands tight, and fixing her eyes
upon the sky, she would send a cry from her
heart to the Throne for victory.  It was a
silent cry.
</p>

<p>
Margaret guessed the greatness of the fight
as she watched the little girl's battling for
control, her figure tense with emotion.  But
God, Who reads the secrets of every heart,
heard the unbreathed words, "You&mdash;you
Who love me, now while I am bad, help me
not to say the nasty words, and to conquer";
a child's prayer, but how precious!  Slowly
but surely her character was strengthened,
and the sweetness of disposition predominated
over the wilful selfishness which had formerly
held full sway.
</p>

<p>
It was at this period of her life that
something occurred to break up the quiet serenity
of Oaklands.  The place was very isolated.
The parish boasted a tiny church, one of the
very smallest in England, standing on the
edge of the woods, and encircled by about
a dozen cottages, the older inhabitants of
which had never left their native hills or
seen the railway.  A state of things
marvellous indeed in this century of movement,
but none the less true.  Oaklands was the
only house of any standing in the neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
The vicar of Steynham came once on
Sunday and held a service in the church;
beyond that, visitors rarely found their way
to this little old-world hamlet, where Time
had swept away most of the traces of a former
civilisation which in past days had dwelt in
the vicinity of the great forest.  Nothing
but a waterless moat and a ruined wall
remained to mark the spot where a bishop's
palace had once been.  The Elizabethan
residence bearing its name Oaklands,
redolent of the forest district in which it stood,
was quaint and picturesque.  Its leaded
windows, gables, and oak-panelled frontage,
with massive beams running across the
ceilings of the rooms, and handsome wainscotings
to the walls, gave it a quaint, old-world
air.
</p>

<p>
The farm was such a poor one, that when
the last tenant had died, the place had
remained empty and out of repair for a long
time, and it was through an advertisement
that the Medhursts had first heard of it and
had decided, in their search for a home far
from the madding crowd, to do it up and live
there in strict retirement.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Margaret awoke one morning to a sense of
oppression which at first seemed to cloud all
her faculties.  A great lethargy pervaded
her whole being; then an unpleasant difficulty
in breathing caused her to struggle, and
she awoke.  Panting with the effort, she
became conscious of a suffocating sense of
smoke choking her mouth and nostrils.
Margaret Woodford was always resourceful,
and as the fact impressed itself upon her
mind that there was danger and difficulty,
with an almost superhuman effort she roused
herself sufficiently to slide out of bed and
stagger to the door.  As she opened it, she was
met by an increased density of smoke which,
with the draught from the staircase window,
poured into her apartment.  But a rush of
sweet fresh air from a landing window revived
her, and, crossing to Mr. Medhurst's room,
she rapped at the door, saying in a low voice,
"Can I speak to you, please?"  Quietly he
responded, but as he opened the door her
news was understood instantly.
</p>

<p>
"I will fetch Ellice, and call Betsy,"
Margaret said, and, without waiting for any
answer, she entered Ellice's room and, speaking
reassuringly to her, picked her up in her
strong young arms and carried her out on
to the landing and down the stairs to the
drawing-room, which seemed free from all
taint of fire.
</p>

<p>
"Stay there; don't move, child&mdash;I shall be
back in a moment."  With this she ran again
up the smoke-laden staircase to the second
landing and Betsy's apartment.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Medhurst meanwhile was experiencing
difficulty in arousing his wife; he knew her
heart was not strong, and was anxious not to
alarm her more than was necessary.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately Betsy had been awakened
by hearing the unusual sounds of movement
in the house, and as Margaret came up the
staircase to her room, she opened her door,
to be met by the increasing volume of
smoke.
</p>

<p>
With senseless panic she threw up her arms
and shrieked wildly, "Fire!&mdash;Fire!"  The
wild cry rang through the house, and in a
moment Mrs. Medhurst was all too effectively
aroused:
</p>

<p>
"My child!&mdash;my child!  Save her!&mdash;save
her!" she cried, as, clutching her
husband's arm, she emerged on to the
landing.
</p>

<p>
"She is safe, Mrs. Medhurst&mdash;downstairs;
let me help you," said Margaret gently,
going to her further support; but in a moment
Mrs. Medhurst staggered back against her
husband in a fainting condition.  A moment
more, and James came to his master's aid,
and between them they carried her
downstairs.
</p>

<p>
"It is all right, child, your mother feels
faint; now be useful&mdash;put a cushion nicely
for her," said Margaret's quiet voice, as
the terrified child met them at the entrance.
</p>

<p>
Margaret and Betsy set about restoring
Mrs. Medhurst while the master ran to the
cottages nearest for assistance.  More quickly
than in ordinary times it would have seemed
possible, the men arrived with pails of
water brought from the horse-pond.  No
fire-engine was available nearer than six miles,
and a grave danger which has come to
many an isolated farmhouse now threatened
Oaklands.
</p>

<p>
The smoke was issuing in volumes from a
cupboard in the pantry, but no sign of flame
came from there.  Quickly Mr. Medhurst
ran his hands over the surrounding walls, only
to find they were unaffected.
</p>

<p>
"Try the kitchen, sir&mdash;maybe the old
beam's caught," said James.
</p>

<p>
And James was right.  The picturesque
oak beam which crossed the kitchen chimney
was, in the structure of the house carried
down at the back of the old range, and this
had evidently become ignited.  Why it had
endured its torturing position so long without
kindling, no one can say.  Now, as Mr. Medhurst
ran his hand over the walls circling the
mantelshelf, he came upon a spot which was
red hot.
</p>

<p>
"There it is!" he exclaimed, and with a
few blows of a pickaxe a man tore an
opening in the brickwork, quickly to discover
fire raging fiercely where the old beam was
fully alight.  Pails of water, and an old
garden syringe (which was the only thing
in the nature of a hose to be found) soon did
their extinguishing work, and presently the
scent of charred wood and a broken wall were
the only signs of the grave danger which had
threatened Oaklands.
</p>

<p>
"God's mercy it didn't brak out airly in
the neight," muttered a thoughtful helper;
"the ould place would a ben burnt to a
cinder."
</p>

<p>
The results of the fire were not so happily
over as the inmates thought.  From that
day Mrs. Medhurst's strength seemed to
fail her, and Mr. Medhurst and Margaret
both saw the coming change which was to
completely alter the life of everyone of the
household.
</p>

<p>
It was in the glory of August days of
sunshine that Mrs. Medhurst grew daily weaker.
Although sickness had taken away her almost
royal beauty, and left her outwardly little
resemblance to the handsome woman who
had first welcomed Margaret into her home,
there was now a sweet expression upon the
patient face of the invalid.  Sorrow had
touched her deeply, but in the trouble she had
turned to One of Whom it is said, "He knows
what lies in the darkness."  And into the
darkness of a thraldom, the chains which
she of herself could not break, He Who alone
can set the devil's captives free, had broken
the fetters which had bound her.
</p>

<p>
"God knows what a temptation I have had
at times, Miss Woodford," she had whispered,
finding relief at last in pouring her story into
sympathetic ears.  "Jewels attracted me so
by their luxurious beauty.  I stole some
beads when I was a little child, and later a
watch with pearl initials, and later still other
small things I hid, and was afraid to wear&mdash;and
for years I deceived my friends.  Then
my father found out I had something which
a friend staying at my home accused me of
taking&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;he turned me out&mdash;and
it was when I was trying to earn my
living I met my husband first.  I never
told him my weakness for fear he would
turn from me, and I had no strength from
Him you tell me of&mdash;He Who is mighty to save&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And forgive," whispered Margaret gently.
The tears came into Lucille Medhurst's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know now.  You have shown me
His love, and I can go to Him without
fear."
</p>

<p>
Margaret's heart thrilled as she heard these
words.
</p>

<p>
"It is not all my story&mdash;but&mdash;I have
told Him&mdash;my Saviour&mdash;and the burden is gone."
</p>

<p>
Then she roused for a little.
</p>

<p>
"And&mdash;my children&mdash;Miss Woodford?"  The
glance was interrogatory and pleading.
</p>

<p>
"I will do anything I can," said Margaret,
with tears of pity, as she lightly pressed the
patient's hands.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Medhurst closed her eyes, and an
expression of relief fell upon her face.  Gently
and peacefully she passed into the new land
of God's Love, where the wicked cease from
troubling and the weary are at rest.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
AN OLD CRIME
</h3>

<p>
With a thoughtful air Horace Hatherley
put down the newspaper, where he had
been studying the column of Births, Deaths,
and Marriages, and with an expression of
abstraction gazed out into the garden in front
of him, deep in retrospect.
</p>

<p>
His friend Dr. Crane's voice broke the spell.
</p>

<p>
"What's the problem, Hatherley?" asked
the newcomer, pausing by his chair as he
spoke.
</p>

<p>
"A name here" (indicating the newspaper
upon his knee) "has brought back old
days, and a dramatic episode to my mind."
</p>

<p>
"What is it?&mdash;let's have the tale if it's
worth the telling."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Hatherley did not answer at once&mdash;but
after a slight pause:
</p>

<p>
"This is in confidence," he said seriously&mdash;"there
is something I should like to share
with you; as I said, a name long unheard,
as far as I am concerned, has caught my
eye, and brought back an old doubt to my
mind."
</p>

<p>
"You may trust me," said Dr. Crane,
sitting down, and pulling his pipe out of his
pocket, which he lighted with a taper ignited
at the glowing fire in front of him.
</p>

<p>
"I see here," began Horace Hatherley,
"the death of Lucille Medhurst"&mdash;picking
up the paper again and pointing to the
announcement as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
A flash of interest kindled in his friend's
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;what of it?  Did you know her?"
</p>

<p>
"Slightly&mdash;I met her first upon her wedding
day.  He&mdash;her husband&mdash;was&mdash;my&mdash;friend."
</p>

<p>
These last words were said slowly, and
sadly.
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;Medhurst of that address&mdash;Oaklands,
Wychcliff?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;that one."
</p>

<p>
"Then you know something of him now?
Excuse me asking, but Margaret Woodford
from the Abbey House here, went to that
man's home as governess when her father
died&mdash;he failed, you may remember?"
</p>

<p>
Dr. Hatherley nodded.
</p>

<p>
"What do you know of them?  As a
matter of fact, I've been a little worried,"
continued Dr. Crane, "that my old friend
Woodford's daughter went to their house:
whispers have reached me of some mystery
attaching to the place.  It certainly seems
an out-of-the-way spot for a man, whom
I believe is a gentleman of means, to live in."
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;he's wealthy, but there is a reason&mdash;but
remember, Crane&mdash;I repeat it, if I divulge
to you Medhurst's story, I do it in confidence.
He was my friend&mdash;and I am his friend while
I have breath."
</p>

<p>
"I quite understand, and will fully respect
the confidence whatever it is," answered
Dr. Crane.  The last words&mdash;"I am his
friend"&mdash;and the warm tone of the speaker's
voice, had done a good deal to reassure the
listener.
</p>

<p>
"Medhurst was at school and college with
me, one of the best and straightest chaps one
could ever meet, and we were closely in touch
with one another after our 'Varsity days.
Then he went abroad for a few years, travelling
for the sole purpose of seeing the world&mdash;money,
of course, being no object.  We
corresponded at first, and then it dropped,
and I lost sight of him, until he surprised me
one day by writing to announce his approaching
marriage with a girl, half Spanish by
birth, whom he had met abroad, and who
was staying with friends in town at that
moment.
</p>

<p>
"Well, to make a long story short, I was
invited to the wedding, which shortly after
took place, and in fact to be Gordon's best
man.  It was then I saw Lucille Don Rosa for
the first time, and I was not surprised at
my friend's infatuation, for she was a very
beautiful girl, but with a proud cold beauty
and a detached air which made me wonder
even then if my friend had made a mistake
in his choice.
</p>

<p>
"However, time passed, and I saw little
of them; they lived in a society whirl, and I
was, as you know, a hardworking student
scarcely in their swim.  Then quite suddenly
tragedy closed their door of happiness.
Lady Crosby held a big reception, they
were among the guests, and I, probably
through their influence, received an invitation.
</p>

<p>
"The thing wasn't in my line, but I decided
to accept.  There was a big crowd, and a
Miss Vandevor, an American heiress, was
present, wearing a very famous ruby necklace.
Of course detectives mingled with the
crowd.  Before the evening was half over
all exits were closed, and it was announced
that Miss Vandevor's necklace had been
stolen&mdash;unclasped from her throat in the
crush.
</p>

<p>
"The suggestion was then made that we
men should turn out our pockets&mdash;and,
Crane, I can tell you this, during those
moments I received the biggest shock of my
life, for Medhurst, before any detective
approached him, took the gems from his
pocket, and in a dead kind of voice said,
'I see it's hopeless to escape, so I admit I
was tempted.'  He laid the necklace in the
owner's lap, and then stood motionless,
facing the crowd almost with a defiant
expression it seemed to be, although he was
white to his lips.
</p>

<p>
"His wife fainted dead away, and was
carried from the room.  I was stunned for
the moment, then I moved to his side, and
expostulated.
</p>

<p>
"'My dear old chap,' I said, 'you don't
know what you are saying; there's a
mistake somewhere&mdash;some thief present has
evidently dropped the thing into your pocket.'  It
was an illuminating thought, and I turned
to the public and made the suggestion loudly.
'Surely someone has seen this done,' I added,
with great assurance.  'No, I took it&mdash;I
coveted its possession, and I am ready to
bear the consequences,' was his answer."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Hatherley paused, then continued:
"Well, the whole horrible story was repeated
at the trial, although I urged a plea should
be put forward for sudden aberration of the
brain, in my confidence as to my friend's
innocence; of course no one heeded me, and
he was convicted and&mdash;and&mdash;suffered&mdash;a&mdash;nine
months'&mdash;sentence."
</p>

<p>
Horace Hatherley's voice shook as he
finished, and for a little neither of the men
spoke, then he resumed: "Mrs. Medhurst was
practically ignored by her so-called friends,
and vanished, I know not where&mdash;probably to
this out-of-the-way place you mention.  No
one seemed to remember her after the first
whirl of excitement was over, and as to
the husband, his memory seemed to be
blotted out by most of those who had known
him.
</p>

<p>
"But I say this, Crane, I am as confident
to-day, as I was at his trial, that in some
way there was a miscarriage of justice,
and somewhere in the world may live the
man or woman he was screening.  It seems
hardly just to suggest it, but the thought
will come sometimes&mdash;could it have been
his wife?  And yet, poor lady, I have
no reason for doubting her.  Seeing her
death announced made the whole thing
come back to my mind with revivified force."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Crane's pipe had long since gone out
for lack of attention.
</p>

<p>
"It's a wonderfully sad and yet interesting
story," he remarked; "I will of course keep
it to myself, but had I known this earlier, I
should certainly have tried to save Margaret
Woodford from going to employers with this
shadow over them."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you needn't worry," said his friend,
a little testily, "or I shall be sorry I told you;
you may take it from me, any woman would
be safe under the care of such a chivalrous
gentleman as Gordon Medhurst.  There is a
mistake somewhere; I hope in some way&mdash;God's
way, perhaps&mdash;his name will be cleared."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
It was some weeks later that Dr. Hatherley
noticed another announcement
in his morning paper which brought a fervent
"Thank God!" to his lips as he read it.  It
was headed:
</p>

<p class="t3">
"AN OLD SOCIETY CRIME RECALLED
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Through her lawyers the late Lucille
Medhurst wishes it to be known that she
alone was responsible for the loss of Miss
Vandevor's necklace ten years ago; her
husband, who suffered the full penalty of the
law, was wholly innocent.  Her full
confession is in our hands."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I always knew he was innocent," said
his friend, laying the paper down with a
sigh of relief.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br><br>
HAPPINESS
</h3>

<p>
The tragedy of Mrs. Medhurst's death
had wrought many changes.  Ellice
had been sent away to a boarding-school at
Margaret's suggestion, and she herself had
gone to live with Mrs. Crane as companion&mdash;but,
as that lady put it in her letter, "more
as a daughter of the house than a dependent,
dear&mdash;the daughter I have always wanted to
take care of us in our old age."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Medhurst went abroad for a few years,
and then something new and unexpected
happened which changed the lives of all the
inmates of Oaklands.
</p>

<p>
Under the old oak tree a girl sat, her head
buried in her hands in an abandonment of
grief: it was Ellice Medhurst, no longer the
little child who had in earlier years fled to
the woods to soothe her childish griefs, but a
tall girl of fifteen, merging into womanhood.
Near her stood a young man looking down
upon her with rather a puzzled countenance,
a slight frown wrinkling his forehead.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see what's the use of making a
fuss, Ellice," he remarked.
</p>

<p>
"Because it won't be anything to you&mdash;you
will be off to college directly," she
answered, "and I shall be left with her.  I
won't bear it, Bob&mdash;I can't.  I know I shall
hate her&mdash;and father will&mdash;will never think
of me&mdash;now," she ended with a sob.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Sis," said her brother, after
a slight pause, "I think it's mean of you to
take up this attitude.  Here's father coming
home to-day, and because he's chosen to
marry again, you are putting yourself out,
and making up your mind to be as beastly as
you can to her&mdash;his wife, I mean.  I know
you&mdash;you can be nasty when you like&mdash;at
least you used to be," he corrected.  "You've
been jolly decent lately; now you are going
to spoil it all by being mean."
</p>

<p>
"Mean?  I don't understand.  In what way
am I mean&mdash;and to whom?"
</p>

<p>
"To father, of course," was the emphatic
answer&mdash;at Ellice's amazed repetition of the
words.  "You are going to spoil all his
happiness by taking up this role of being
injured.  Dad will, of course, want you to
like her&mdash;the message in his letter is plain
enough, 'I hope you will do your best to give
us both a welcome'&mdash;and all I can say is,
whatever <i>you</i> do, I mean to go home and
receive them.  Come on, Sis, pull yourself
together!  It doesn't say much for your love
for dad, if you set out to cause him trouble
like this, and spoil his happiness.  Be nice;
very likely she won't be half bad.  I expect
she dreads seeing us quite as much as we
dread seeing her.  What's the honour of
keeping smiling only when things are pleasant?
Come on&mdash;get over it.  I'm off; it's nearly
time they arrived."
</p>

<p>
There was silence for a moment, and Bob
stood fidgeting by his sister, then in
half-disgusted tones he said:
</p>

<p>
"I can't wait any longer for you; if you
won't come&mdash;you <i>won't</i>."  And with a quick
stride he turned and made his way down the
avenue towards home.
</p>

<p>
For a few minutes longer the struggle for
victory went on in Ellice Medhurst's heart,
then suddenly she jumped up with the
muttered words, "I'll try; Bob must be right."  She
ran lightly down the path after him, and
caught him up at the edge of the wood.
</p>

<p>
"I'm coming with you," she whispered
breathlessly, as she grasped his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Well done, young 'un!" he answered.
"Come on, we must run, or we shall be late."
</p>

<p class="thought">

</p>

<p>
"Here they come!" shouted Bob, as two
figures turned into the drive&mdash;a smothered
exclamation escaped him as he rushed to the
front door.
</p>

<p>
Ellice did not follow immediately, her knees
were shaking, and she felt strung up to such
a pitch of mental excitement she hardly felt
capable of following Bob at first.  Then
suddenly she heard her father's voice saying,
"Where's Ellice?"  The reaction came
immediately; she flew to the door, and threw
herself blindly into her father's arms with
a smothered sob.
</p>

<p>
"Why, ladybird, what is it?" he said,
stroking her hair gently.  "Look&mdash;have you
no word of welcome for my wife?"
</p>

<p>
"Ellice, dear child," said Margaret's voice
gently.
</p>

<p>
The girl started, raising her head, and
looked wonderingly into the sweet face of her
old governess.  Then the great fact dawned
upon her mind&mdash;Margaret Woodford, whom
she loved, was the new stepmother she had
dreaded.
</p>

<p>
"You?&mdash;<i>You?</i>" she exclaimed, clasping
the hands extended towards her.  "Oh,
how lovely!"
</p>

<p>
Tears of joy glistened in Margaret's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I think you can see the reward of other
years now, can't you?" whispered her
husband, and Margaret did see, and was
wondrously content.
</p>

<p class="thought">

</p>

<p>
Two months passed quickly away&mdash;two
months of unalloyed happiness to Margaret
in her new life.
</p>

<p>
It was her birthday, and she stood looking
out upon the frost-clothed lawn glistening
in a bath of winter sunshine, waiting for the
others to come down to breakfast.  It was
November&mdash;cold, still, and bright.
</p>

<p>
Presently she felt her husband's hand
upon her shoulder, and heard his voice saying:
</p>

<p>
"Many happy returns!  Here is my double
present for your wedding and your birthday,"
and he placed an important looking envelope
in her hands.
</p>

<p>
At first Margaret gazed at the packet
uncomprehendingly, then the nature of the
gift became clear.
</p>

<p>
"<i>The Abbey House!</i>" she exclaimed.
"You have bought the Abbey&mdash;House&mdash;Gordon?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and I now present it to my wife,"
he said gaily.  "I hope she is pleased?"
</p>

<p>
"Pleased?  I can scarcely believe it&mdash;the
dear old home&mdash;ours?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, the late owners are going abroad
and wanted to sell, and at last I have got
what I have been hoping to have the opportunity
of purchasing for some time.  We will
go there to live, dear, as soon as you like."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know how to thank you!&mdash;it
is beyond my wildest dreams," answered
Margaret.  "I so loved the place.  But,
Gordon (the brightness fading a little from
her face), how will Ellice like leaving
Oaklands?  She is just as attached to it as I
was to the old home."
</p>

<p>
"I know," answered Mr. Medhurst; "we
will keep it, dear, and come out here in
the summer months.  Betsy and James can
remain in charge."
</p>

<p>
"That will be splendid, and please us all,"
she answered quietly, adding, as if to herself,
"I sometimes wonder why God has been so
bountiful to me."
</p>

<p>
We leave Margaret Woodford, while yet
the ministry of life is unfinished, and her
future and that of her loved ones an unwritten
page, knowing that for her and all God's
servants, the promise remains unshakable&mdash;"I
will be with thee all the days.  When
thou passest through the waters, they shall
not overflow thee."
